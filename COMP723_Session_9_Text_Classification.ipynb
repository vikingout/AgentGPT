            "[b'america loves convenience . \\nafter all , we\\'re the culture that invented the cell phone , the 24-hour atm , and my most beloved , the remote control . \\nyet perhaps this time , with ghosts of mars , we have taken our love of convenience to far . \\nghosts of mars stars natasha henstridge as a tough as nails , pill-poppin\\' , martian cop , sent with her squadron to retrieve \" demolition \" williams ( ice cube ) from a remote mining town for trial back home . \\nwhen she and her comrades , appropriately dubbed \" the commander , \" \" the rookies , \" and the guy with the cool accent discover the town\\'s residents slaughtered , they are forced to team up with williams to escape from the remaining residents\\' head-chopping , alien-possessed clutches . \\nfilled with a lovely overuse of storytelling flashbacks , flashes-sideways , and viewpoint changes , ghosts of mars is a hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and ill-conceived action sequences . \\nthe only thing keeping this film from becoming an incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity of its story . \\nripped straight from the pages of a 1970s zombie movie , ghosts leaps from one convenient moment to the next , stopping only to kill the characters which are most convenient to lose . \\nattempts at character interaction and development are rare and forced . \\nmost of these moments come off as kwik-e-mart wisdom , dispensed heartily around the slushee machine of life by the even-tempered streetwise hand of ice cube . \\nwith a gun in one hand and a dynamite cap in the other , cube reminisces about his street life , comparing the zombie-stomping fun to \" me and my brother when we was kids . \" \\napparently , crime in the bronx has gotten so bad that the residents have actually taken to ritually decapitating one another for entertainment . \\nbut , even in the film\\'s darkest moments , fate conveniently lends a hand , supplying heavily armored transportation and easily accessible rifles and dynamite . \\nyes , in the future , man may travel to space and conquer mars , but nothing beats a good stick of tnt . \\nand as we all know , every police station , past , present , or future , keeps a healthy supply on hand . \\ncharacters die , heads are lopped off , but they were only supporting roles anyway , so why should we care ? \\nas long as you have plenty of narcotics , immunity is guaranteed . \\neventually though , even the most well-trained zombie alien gets a bit uppity and needs to be taught a lesson . \\nwhat better way than by sacrificing a few minor characters to a convenient nuclear detonation , killing anything the machine guns can\\'t handle . \\nexplosions are fun . \\nand even if the nukes don\\'t get them , the conveniently placed dynamite packs on the train stolen from the set of the road warrior certainly will . \\nin the end this film defines itself when our cop\\'s tribunal pronounces , \" is that all you have to tell us ? \" \\nfor , indeed , john carpenter has run out of things to say , and has instead decided to use whatever is convenient to tell a ridiculously bad story . \\n', b'dreamworks pictures presents a jinks/ cohen company production kevin spacey annette bening \" american beauty \" thora birch allison janney peter gallagher mena suvari wes bentley and chris cooper co-producers stan wlodkowski alan ball music by thomas newman costume designer julie weiss film editor tariq anway chris greenbury production designer naomi shohan director of photography conrad l . hall , a . s . c . \\nproduced by bruce cohen & dan jinks written by alan ball directed by sam mendes \\n \" both my wife and daughter think i\\'m this gigantic loser . \\nand they\\'re right . \\ni have lost something . \\ni didn\\'t always feel this sedated . \" \\nwith that piece of dialogue , we are fully introduced to lester burnham ( kevin spacey ) , a 42 year old man trapped within his own life . \\nlester works for an advertising agency . \\nhis growing dissatisfaction with his job is only one of the mid-life crisis he is suffering . \\nestranged from both his wife and his daughter , lester starts to crack under the stress . \\nhis life becomes nothing more than a series of mastubatory fantasies , and sullen apathy . \\ncarolyn burnham ( annette bening ) , is the prototypical career woman/ homemaker . \\nshe carefully tends her rose garden , decorates her home with the best furnishings . \\nbut inside she is desperate . \\nunsuccessful at her profession as a real estate agent , she drives herself into states of denial and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family . \\nthe third member of this anti-family is jane burnham ( thora birch ) , lester and carolyn\\'s daughter . \\na young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence , but having to also come to terms with her families growing dysfunction . \\nthis funny ( and frightening ) slice of life is refreshingly simple . \\nnot one character is given less than is needed to identify him or her . \\nsome of the most telling characters are those that serve to highlight other characters . \\nmost notably is barbara fitts ( allison janney ) , the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts . \\nshe has almost no dialogue , and seems to be either recovering from a stroke or suffering from one . \\ncolonel fitts ( chris cooper ) is an angry and frightened man . \\nhis rage directed almost singularly at his son , ricky ( wes bentley ) who has just moved with his family to the same neighborhood as the burnham\\'s . \\nin fact they are the next door neighbors . \\nanymore detail into the personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one of the many pleasures and surprises to be had in \" american beauty \" . \\nalan ball , who was the co-executive producer of the hit tv series \" cybil \" and creator of the new sitcom \" oh grow up \" , has fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the past ten years . \\nnot one character in this film rings falsely . \\nand the depth of personality in each , is achingly honest and insightful . \\nthe plot detailing the last year in the life of a man as he tries to find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched and at the same time original as to bring to mind such marvelous film work as \" the graduate \" or \" lolita \" . \\nkevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances . \\nhis lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of a life that is spiraling into old age . \\nfinally unable to deal with the lost soul that he has become , lester tries to return to his youth . \\nhe quits his job ( actually blackmailing his employer for one year\\'s salary ) , starts smoking pot , fantasizes about his daughter\\'s girlfriend angela ( mena suvari , in a marvelous performance here ) , starts working out , and finally takes a job at the local fast food outlet . \\nmr . spacey\\'s performance is so remarkably subtle and ingenuous , that we can be certain that come oscar ? time , we can be assured to see him name among the five nominees . \\nannette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career . \\ncarolyn burnham is a woman who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy . \\nunable to cope with her growing disillusionment , she forces herself to maintain her demeanor , driving her further and further into desperation , adultery and possibly murder . \\nms . bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone . \\nthe slow and methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express in words . \\nthora birch holds her own against the talents cast with her . \\njane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in what is a dysfunctional family , and a rebellious child ready to abandon them at any moment . \\nher growing distrust and isolation from her family is something that many parents should view as a warning . \\nshe is the prototypical trophy child . \\nwhen carolyn praises her daughter after a performance by her cheerleading team ( \" i\\'m so proud of you , honey . \\nyou didn\\'t screw up once ! \" ) , the bitterness and resentment are palpable . \\nthora birch is a young actress to watch . \\npraise must also go to chris cooper who brings yet another angry father role to life with depth and resonance . \\ncolonel finn is a man in complete denial . \\nhis military upbringing masking a desire he is too repulsed to even comprehend . \\nwes bentley as ricky finn is fine as the enigma . \\nthe boy next door who may be more foe than friend . \\na deceitful and calculating young man , whose voyeuristic proclivities mask a deeper and more profound understanding of life than any of the adults around him . \\nmr . bentley\\'s performance is the one troublesome note in the film . \\nthat is simply because the character is such a grand and complete liar , that one almost faults the performance for it . \\ndirector sam mendes handles all of the particulars of the cast and the settings with a sure and composed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle . \\nscenes of carolyn walking through the rain , carry an ominous fission that calls attention to the emotions of the character . \\nthe subtle cinematography by conrad hall is wonderful , capturing the season in all of it\\'s harsh beauty ( fall has never looked so inviting , yet depressing ) . \\nevery nuance of \" american beauty \" begs it\\'s audience to think and examine . \\nit is a film that will be discussed and debated for years to come . \\nand well it should , as it is simply one of this years best . \\n', b\"it is movies like these that make a jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch . \\nbased on the late 1960's television show by the same name , the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police to go undercover . \\nhowever , things go wrong as evidence gets stolen and they are immediately under suspicion . \\nof course , the ads make it seem like so much more . \\nquick cuts , cool music , claire dane's nice hair and cute outfits , car chases , stuff blowing up , and the like . \\nsounds like a cool movie , does it not ? \\nafter the first fifteen minutes , it quickly becomes apparent that it is not . \\nthe mod squad is certainly a slick looking production , complete with nice hair and costumes , but that simply isn't enough . \\nthe film is best described as a cross between an hour-long cop show and a music video , both stretched out into the span of an hour and a half . \\nand with it comes every single clich ? . \\nit doesn't really matter that the film is based on a television show , as most of the plot elements have been recycled from everything we've already seen . \\nthe characters and acting is nothing spectacular , sometimes even bordering on wooden . \\nclaire danes and omar epps deliver their lines as if they are bored , which really transfers onto the audience . \\nthe only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi , who plays the resident crazy man , ultimately being the only thing worth watching . \\nunfortunately , even he's not enough to save this convoluted mess , as all the characters don't do much apart from occupying screen time . \\nwith the young cast , cool clothes , nice hair , and hip soundtrack , it appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset . \\ndespite an american 'r' rating ( which the content does not justify ) , the film is way too juvenile for the older mindset . \\ninformation on the characters is literally spoon-fed to the audience ( would it be that hard to show us instead of telling us ? ) , dialogue is poorly written , and the plot is extremely predictable . \\nthe way the film progresses , you likely won't even care if the heroes are in any jeopardy , because you'll know they aren't . \\nbasing the show on a 1960's television show that nobody remembers is of questionable wisdom , especially when one considers the target audience and the fact that the number of memorable films based on television shows can be counted on one hand ( even one that's missing a finger or two ) . \\nthe number of times that i checked my watch ( six ) is a clear indication that this film is not one of them . \\nit is clear that the film is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the teenage spending dollar , judging from the rash of really awful teen-flicks that we've been seeing as of late . \\navoid this film at all costs . \\n\", b'moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post-salary cap era -- you\\'ve got to know how to allocate your resources . \\nevery dollar spent on a free-agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers . \\nin the nfl , this leads to teams like the detroit lions , who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract , but can only field five guys named herb to block for him . \\nin the movies , you end up with films like \" spawn \" , with a huge special-effects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors . \\njackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking . \\nhe spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line . \\nwatching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid , fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars , is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit , except that sanders doesn\\'t have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages . \\nbut like the lions star , jackie doesn\\'t have anybody to block for him . \\nalmost every cent that\\'s invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts , and as chan does his own stunts , the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills . \\nthis leaves about 75 cents to pay for things like directors ( chan directs ) , scripts and dubbing and supporting characters , not to mention the hideous title sequence . \\nthis also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain . \\n ( chan\\'s first release in this country , \" rumble in the bronx \" , was supposedly set in new york , but was filmed in vancouver , and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible . ) \\nheck , jackie doesn\\'t even have enough money for a haircut , looks like , much less a personal hairstylist . \\nin condor , chan plays the same character he\\'s always played , himself , a mixture of bruce lee and tim allen , a master of both kung-fu and slapstick-fu . \\njackie is sent by the un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert , and is chased by a horde of neo-nazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs ( one of the things i like about jackie chan movies : no political correctness ) . \\nhe is joined by three women , who have little to do except scream , \" jackie , save us ! \" , and misuse firearms . \\nthe villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere , and he\\'s more pathetic than evil . \\nen route , we have an extended motorcycle chase scene , a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with the neo-nazis , and two confrontations with savage natives . \\nonce at the secret desert base , there is a long chop-socky sequence , followed by the film\\'s centerpiece , a wind-tunnel fight that\\'s even better than the one in face/off . \\nthis is where the money was spent , on well-choreographed kung-fu sequences , on giant kevlar hamster balls , on smashed-up crates of bananas , and on scorpions . \\nignore the gaping holes in the plot ( how , exactly , if the villain\\'s legs were broken , did he escape from the secret nazi base , and why didn\\'t he take the key with him ? ) . \\ndon\\'t worry about the production values , or what , exactly , the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara . \\njust go see the movie . \\noperation condor has pretentions of being a \" raiders of the lost ark \" knockoff , but one wonders what jackie could do with the raiders franchise blocking for him -- with a lawrence kazdan screenplay , a john williams score , spielberg directing and george lucas producing , condor might be an a+ movie . \\nhowever , you\\'ve got to go with what you\\'ve got , and what you\\'ve got in jackie chan is something special -- a talent that mainstream hollywood should , could , and ought to utilize . \\n', b' \" he\\'s back , and it\\'s about time . \" \\nwas the motto for this television series pilot ( i call it a pilot , i don\\'t care what fox network says ) revival of the cult classic british tv show , doctor who , that spawned no series , which means there are no smart network execs out there ( not exactly news to a lot of people , i know ) . \\nthe motto was well chosen . \\nthe series was simple , it was about this time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen lives who traveled around in a type forty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddies , including the evil daleks , and the master , who appears in this feature , played very badly by eric roberts . \\nas good as this revival was , there is something missing from it to make sure it was really doctor who . \\nis it the acting ? \\nhell , no ! \\npaul mcgann is just as good as any of the other seven guys who\\'ve played the doctor ( including his predecessor and off-screen friend sylvester mccoy , who appears once more for the regeneration scene ) . \\nhe looks right for the role , is a brilliant actor , and slips effortlessly into the role , the way my two favorites jon pertwee and tom baker would . \\ndaphne ashbrook brings class to her role as dr . grace holloway , the doctor\\'s first companion that he kisses on screen , she is not your typical female companion who screams , and spends her free time making coffee for the doctor , she is a tough , spunky american , and ashbrook shows this well . \\nyoung yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee , and i\\'ve seen him in other stuff in which he usually plays the punk kid who dies at the end ( this film included ) , which , imho , wastes his talent . \\nthe only problem with the acting is eric roberts . \\none time he had to say to mcgann\\'s doctor , \" i always dress for the occasion . \" \\nbut he broke it up , and said it so slowly that it wounded up sounding like a song lyric , \" i always . . . \\ndress . . . \\nfor the occasion . \" \\nyou need an actor less slow and less reliant on moving his hands to act , and who\\'s also british , like mcgann is as the doctor . \\nexecutive producer phil segal said he was casted because fox insisted on having one american star in the role . \\ni dunno who thought of casting him , but if they\\'re reading this : news flash : eric roberts is * not * a star ! \\nhe rides on his sister\\'s coattails , and any hit movie he makes has nothing to do with him . \\nis this problem the kisses to the past ? \\nthey have references to the show so subtle that non fans would not notice them , only whovians would , and they\\'re good . \\nis it the script or the movie as a whole ? \\nthe script is a classy piece of work , featuring a master who can spit slime out of his mouth and nice dialogue , and the movie as a whole is one fans will love , and it is a good stand alone viewing for nonfans to enjoy the series . \\nso what is it ? \\nsimple : no plot . \\nthe master , on his last legs , sends for the doctor to rescue him after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro and exterminate him . \\nthe doctor attempts to take his remains back to gallifrey , but they accidentally land in san francisco , 1999 , december 31 , where the master , with young street hood chang lee\\'s help , opens the eye of harmony , which will suck the earth through it at midnight if the doctor , with the help of female surgeon , dr . grace holloway , doesn\\'t close it by then . \\nvirtually no plot . \\ni was told the movie would\\'ve featured the daleks on screen and started with more of a courtroom drama between the master and the daleks , but a lot of rewriting went on on the set . \\nthat shows how smart people are , as it would have made the movie a hell of a lot more interesting , and that would\\'ve gotten a four star rating out of me . \\n', b'in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer \\\\ professor with such lived-in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance . \\never since wall street , douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid-80\\'s . \\nin those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen , with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world . \\nyou\\'d think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good-natured veneer , but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton , douglas played the role straight and out in the open . \\nin wonder boys his performance isn\\'t showy or a tour de force , it\\'s simple yet truthful . \\nhe embodies grady , a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes . \\ngrady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map . \\nwhen we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop , we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms . \\ngrady points out , in his narration , that they only do so out of jealousy . \\ntheir target is the very writerly named james leer ( played by the always understated tobey maguire ) , a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for . \\nleer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions . \\nhe speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges . \\nhe\\'s portentous and gloomy , as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers , though his act is a little too calculated . \\nhe reminds me of the self-imposed outcast film director , jim jarmusch ( dead man , ghost dog ) . \\nwhenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner ( the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer ) , exclusively dressed in black , and with his spiked hair dyed snow white . \\nleer is similar , a guy who equates quirks with depth . \\ntobey maguire fits well in the role . \\nwith his round , sweet-eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude . \\nbut unlike cort , maguire is easier to warm up to ; he\\'s a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility . \\nkatie holmes plays hannah , a beautiful , talented writing student just itching to get in grady\\'s pants . \\nthis is a plot line i had trouble with . \\ndouglas , in his old age , is beginning to resemble jerry springer , a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions . \\nat first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady ( maybe it\\'s because i\\'m jealous , and wish holmes was throwing herself at me , after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth ) , then i think of douglas\\'s real life companion , the breathtaking catherine zeta jones . \\nseeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping . \\nsuddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand ( that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie ) and i\\'m pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas . \\nthere is a movie in there somewhere . \\ngrady , rather chivalrously if you ask me , resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell ( a droll frances mcdormand ) , who is his age , but also married to another professor . \\nokay , maybe not so chivalrous . \\nthere is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says , \" she was a junkie for the printed word . \\nlucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice \" . \\nrobert downy j . r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm . \\ndowny has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual . \\nhe\\'s arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance . \\nthe actor is perfectly cast here , and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor . \\ni wish wonder boys had more of him . \\nsearching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless , for it meanders through its running time , but that\\'s part of its charm . \\nand maybe i\\'m a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia , a place i\\'m greatly fond of , and a place rarely explored in american cinema . \\neveryone has a sub-genre ( be it war films , westerns , dance movies ) that they happen to be privy to . \\ni\\'m privy to films about literary types i . e . \\nthose individuals enthralled by the written word , and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch . \\nthe direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters , rather than generic mapped out story points . \\nsometimes the dialogue is too clever , but that\\'s a problem i wish i found with films more often . \\nanother minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted , like its characters , but as the story progresses it begins to open up . \\nfor me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types , and as a low-key comedy for its chuckle-worthy throwaway gags . \\nthe gags are like those in the great robert altman ( m * a * s * h , the long goodbye ) movies , where jokes exist as asides on the fringes , like jokes in life often do . \\nthe broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog , and incessant smoking of marijuana isn\\'t ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things . \\ncurtis hanson , who before his last film , la confidential , toiled about with exploitation fare like losin\\' it ( an early tom cruise sex comedy ) and the hand the rocks the cradle , has graduated to more meaningful films . \\nhe directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style , the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up . \\nthe morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party , but in a wonder boys party , it fits . \\nthe film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen . \\nit\\'s the cinematic equivalent to a good read , novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies . \\nmany will find it slight , but i found much to savor among its subtleties . \\n', b'i\\'m really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone . \\nsure , she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god\\'s green earth ( second only to that movie critic at large guy ) , but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in , she always strikes out . \\nthe crush was a slow-moving , predictable piece of fluff . \\nhideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in . \\nclueless was an annoying , unfunny waste of time . \\nand people have e-mailed me too , saying clueless is a good movie and that i\\'m the only one who doesn\\'t like it . \\none girl said if i\\'d seen the movie with \" an open mind , \" i would have enjoyed it . \\nnothing could be further from the truth . \\ni went into the theater expecting to love the movie . \\nthe preview looked good and of course i\\'m crazymadinlove with alicia , but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny , unlikable characters . \\nalmost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way . \\nwhen we were walking out of the theater , one guy ( and it wasn\\'t me ) yelled out , \" that was the worst f$&#in\\' movie i\\'ve ever seen \" and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement . \\nso last night i walked into the video store and saw alicia\\'s pretty face on the cover of some made-for-video thriller called the babysitter . \\ni knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion i\\'ll probably never understand made me rent it anyway . \\nwhat i got was 90 minutes of regret--the worst alicia silverstone movie ever . \\nand you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like . \\nwhere to begin in criticizing this movie ? \\nthe plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier , the writing could have been done ( and for all we know it was ) by a ten year old , alicia is the star and she\\'s still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever . \\nthere is zero humor , zero suspense , zero drama and zero action , until the last ten minutes , when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence . \\nzero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero . \\nso why does this movie get one star out of me ? \\nwell , alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub . \\nand if it wasn\\'t bubble bath , the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four- star features , but you settle for what you can get . \\nalicia plays a babysitter who\\'s spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party . \\nand of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home ( at least that movie critic at large guy does ) . \\nas the movie trods along , we discover she\\'s not only the mostly-silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character\\'s fantasies ( and probably every male viewer\\'s too ) . \\nthe drunken father thinks she\\'s just the thing to recapture his lost youth , her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside , even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she\\'s taking her bubble bath . \\nthey even throw in the middle aged wife\\'s fantasies about a male counterpart at the party . \\nnot that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200+ pound woman in a black silk teddy . \\nat least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg-rated . \\nin fact , i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax late-night staple if not for the fact that there\\'s absolutely no nudity in it . \\nso you can\\'t call it a sex flick . \\ni\\'ve already pointed out that it can\\'t fall under drama , comedy , thriller or action , so what do you classify the babysitter as ? \\nbad . \\n', b'plot : a young man who loves heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon , to whom he\\'s devoted a tribute band in which he sings , gets launched into stardom when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his place . \\ncritique : i\\'m a sucker for movies like this . \\na young man with a humble background and lofty dreams , works hard , devotes the time , the energy and the patience , and ultimately hits it big-time . \\nin the case of this film , our boy loves a certain heavy metal band and as luck would have it ( yup , luck always finds its way into these types of equations , although generally tied very closely to hard work ) , they need a new singer . \\nhis entry and adaptation to the whole \" rock \\'n roll \" lifestyle fills the rest of the film and is really fun to watch . \\nalthough i will preface this by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love ( or past love ) of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it . \\nmetal was one of my first loves as a teen and even though the genre of music isn\\'t that prominent anymore , i still check out my motley crue , twisted sister and anthrax cds every now and again . \\nthat\\'s not to say that you won\\'t like this film if you don\\'t like the music , but the music and live performances from the band , play a big part in the movie , and i for one , had a blast watching and listening to it all . \\nbut the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by mark wahlberg . \\nwow , hand this fella some major props , as he totally becomes this heavy metal geek/god ( incidentally , metal god was the film\\'s original title , and a much better one if you ask me ) . \\nhe is this movie and i was quite taken by his character pretty much the whole way through . \\nhe came off like a regular guy with extremely passionate goals and work ethic , who was willing to do anything in order to fulfill his dreams . \\naniston was also surprisingly good as the girlfriend ( and the romance angle between them was sweet ) , but she didn\\'t pull me in hard enough during their emotional scenes . \\ni was also impressed by some of the \" real \" musicians who played in the film ( zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne , jeff pilson from dokken , stephan jenkins from third eye blind , blas elias from slaughter ) , but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band members . \\nit\\'s to note that this film was based on a real-life tale of a young man who used to sing in a judas priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer ( their original singer also admitted to being gay , as in this film ) . \\njust for the record , i\\'m certainly not recommending this film for its originality or surprise elements , since most of this stuff has already been covered in some way or another in other movies , but because it\\'s a fun , uplifting , well-paced movie with a solid central showing by wahlberg and energetic live performances . \\noh yeah , and for those who dig the \" heavier \" side of music , the soundtrack also rocks ! ! \\nyou see . . . dreams \\ncan come true . . . \\nwhere\\'s joblo coming from ? \\nalmost famous ( 8/10 ) - blow ( 8/10 ) - boogie nights ( 9/10 ) - detroit rock city ( 8/10 ) - girlfight ( 6/10 ) - goodfellas ( 10/10 ) \\n', b' \" jaws \" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen . \\nthe movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds . \\nthen it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams\\' now infamous score . \\ndah-dum . \\nfrom there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly . \\nright away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once \" jaws \" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip . \\nperhaps what is most outstanding about \" jaws \" is how spielberg builds the movie . \\nhe works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act . \\nunlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act . \\nuntil then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams\\' music . \\nhe\\'s building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark\\'s arrival is truly terrifying . \\nhe doesn\\'t let us get bored with the imagery . \\nthe first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn\\'t been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years . \\nthe island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn\\'t want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money . \\nbrody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute . \\nhooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( \" it\\'s a perfect engine , an eating machine \" ) make it that much more terrifying . \\nwhen vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark . \\nthe entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it . \\n \" jaws \" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror . \\nit is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it\\'s no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by \" star wars \" ) . \\neven today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock\\'s \" psycho , \" and it never seems to age . \\nalthough grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill . \\nthe technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects . \\nscheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time \" jaws \" was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman . \\nnevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark . \\nscheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what\\'s right and going against the entire town . \\n \" it\\'s your first summer here , you know , \" mayor vaughn warns him . \\ndreyfuss , who had previously been seen in \" american graffiti \" ( 1973 ) and \" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz \" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers . \\nhowever , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie\\'s captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards . \\nbordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism . \\nhe\\'s slightly deranged , and shaw\\'s performance is almost a caricature . \\nhowever , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars . \\nquint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s . \\nindianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese . \\nhis tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen . \\nshaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film . \\nof course , we can\\'t leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind\\'s fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature . \\na shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in \" jaws , \" and they are a threat . \\nevery one of spielberg\\'s subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into . \\nthe shark in \" jaws \" was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed \" bruce \" by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles . \\nmany have forgotten , but \" jaws \" was a sort of precursor to \" waterworld \" ( 1995 ) , a movie\\'s who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb . \\nbut , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood . \\n', b'the ultimate match up between good and evil , \" the untouchables \" is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry . \\nbased on the 1959 television show of the same title , \" the untouchables \" may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script . \\nthe film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public . \\nelliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order . \\nhowever , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws . \\nthe fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes . \\nthe film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws . \\nthe film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone\\'s men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl . \\nfrom this point we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard . \\nright from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs . \\nthis developed hatred is before the film\\'s hero , ness , is even introduced . \\ni found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone . \\nthe film only gets better from this point . \\nwith the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats . \\nthey walk in unison and they only look forward . \\nas they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens . \\nholding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films . \\none that comes to mind is \" the matrix \" when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world . \\nwearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930\\'s style , the similarities between these two are countless . \\n \" the untouchables \" has some of the hippest , bravest heroes in any action film . \\nthe four members were the only ones willing to go against capone\\'s army . \\neach member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others . \\nelliot ness , played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner , is a character that surely grows during the course of the film . \\nhe begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be . \\nhowever , as the film develops so does ness . \\nhis beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side . \\nhe also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends . \\nhis anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in . \\nsean connery , who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role , plays malone , an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables . \\nmalone acts as a mentor to ness . \\nhe teaches him \" the chicago way \" to do things ; when they attack with a knife , you attack with a gun . \\nconnery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed . \\nandy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone , a young man who is just becoming a police officer . \\nas ness grows , he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him . \\ncharles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone . \\nsmith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film . \\nthe action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen . \\nalso very similar to \" the matrix , \" they are exciting and intense . \\n>from a western-like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps , the scenes are well thought out and well executed . \\nthe score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement . \\nits pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors . \\nthe combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective . \\nalthough the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified , this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting , great directing , and great action . \\nsome scenes ( capone and the baseball bat , the train station ) have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid . \\n', b\"you've got mail works alot better than it deserves to . \\nin order to make the film a success , all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars , have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits . \\nno real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it's body ( it's basically a complete re-shoot of the shop around the corner , only adding a few modern twists ) . \\nessentially , it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking . \\nit's overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy , not to mention very manipulative . \\nbut oh , how enjoyable that manipulation is . \\nbut there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does , because i absolutely hated the previous ryan/hanks teaming , sleepless in seattle . \\nit couldn't have been the directing , because both films were helmed by the same woman . \\ni haven't quite yet figured out what i liked so much about you've got mail , but then again , is that really important ? \\nif you like something so much , why even question it ? \\nagain , the storyline is as cliched as they come . \\ntom hanks plays joe fox , the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley , the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a family-run children's book shop called , in a nice homage , the shop around the corner . \\nfox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business . \\nlittle do they know , they are already in love with each other over the internet , only neither party knows the other person's true identity . \\nthe rest of the story isn't important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen . \\nsure , there are some mildly interesting subplots , but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship . \\nall of this , of course , leads up to the predictable climax . \\nbut as foreseeable as the ending is , it's so damn cute and well-done that i doubt any movie in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does . \\nwhen ryan discovers the true identity of her online love , i was filled with such , for lack of a better word , happiness that for the first time all year , i actually left the theater smiling . \\n\", b'if there\\'s one thing in common about all of hollywood\\'s major studios , it\\'s that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more . \\nalthough twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures ( fox searchlight and fine line respectively ) , it\\'s obvious there\\'s no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater . \\nso when a movie like gary ross\\' pleasantville comes along , wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production , it\\'s a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes . \\nalthough the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted , pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no-thought movie . \\nquite the opposite is true , in fact , as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen . \\nthe story , both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation , captures the essence of statement-making in the cinema . \\nnot in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution , and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross\\' work , it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough . \\nkudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture . \\nit stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who , through quite a bit of luck , find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named \" pleasantville . \" \\nmaguire , as the reserved bud parker , is perfect for the pseudo-world ; but the rebellious mary sue ( witherspoon ) is not at all made for the father-knows-best times . \\nit\\'s not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end , and begins to teach the townspeople - in a quite unlikely way - what life is * really * like . \\nsoon hues of color creep into the black and white world , and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism , others fear the strangeness . \\nat one end is a soda shop owner-turned-painter named mr . johnson ( jeff daniels ) and at the other end is a close-minded mayor ( j . t . \\nwalsh ) and his chamber of commerce ; but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town . \\nfine performances are turned in all around . \\nmaguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads , but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j . t . \\nwalsh ( in his latest and final posthumous performance ) . \\ndaniels brings an atmosphere of awe , inspiration , and hope to his character , whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness - almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman\\'s envy . \\nfor daniels , it\\'s his most commendable performance of the last three years - or more - and for walsh , it\\'s a complementary exclamation point on a fine career . \\nalso of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen , and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish . \\nthere\\'s not much to dislike about pleasantville , and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who don\\'t . \\n', b'a fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july ! \\n>from ace ventura to truman burbank , jim carrey has run the whole gamut of comic , yet sympathetic , characters . \\n1996\\'s the cable guy was supposed to be his big \" breakthrough \" role from zany humor into darker , more dramatic acting . \\nas most everyone knows , the results were , well , less-than-stellar . \\nnot only did the film not do so hot at the box office , but it was also panned by critics . \\nas far as i know , gene siskel and i are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it . \\nthe first time i saw the cable guy , in theatres , i was in super critic-mode , and didn\\'t really like it . \\nhowever , due to the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day , i\\'ve had time to lean back , relax , and take in the film . \\nand to my surprise , it grew on me . \\nthe plot is rather simple : broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy , played by carrey , then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship . \\nsee , steven\\'s been having some problems with his girlfriend , robin ( leslie mann ) , and he doesn\\'t think he has any more room in his life for a new friend . \\nalso , some of the cable guy\\'s antics have been creeping him out . \\ncarrey , as the cable guy , gives steven various aliases , which later we find out are all tv characters : larry tate , chip douglas , ricky ricardo , etc . he apparently lives in his cable van , and while many critics didn\\'t enjoy this newer , darker , less-manic performance from carrey , i thought it was interesting and rather well-done . \\nfor me , its not the movie as a whole that\\'s enjoyable , but rather several individual scenes : a karaoke jam at steven\\'s apartment , a medieval fight at a theme restaurant , and a bathroom beating ( a la liar , liar ) , just to name a few . \\nperhaps the fact that more of carrey\\'s humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny . \\nand if you really want to see something , you\\'ve got to hear his version of jefferson airplane\\'s \" somebody to love \" , sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam . \\nthe cable guy has its bad spots , like most any movie . \\ni didn\\'t particularly like steven\\'s girlfriend , and i felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend . \\nalso , the ending , while having you fooled for a moment , is rather contrived , and somewhat dissapointing . \\nstill , i found the cable guy to be a worthwhile venture ; if you\\'re at the video store and can\\'t think of anything to rent , i suggest you try it out . \\nor if you have hbo , just wait till it comes on ( you won\\'t have to wait long . ) \\nhell , that\\'s what i do every day . \\n', b'a movie like mortal kombat : annihilation works ( and must be reviewed on ) multiple levels . \\nfirst , there\\'s the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie . \\nbut occasionaly , almost as if making an ironic , self-depreciating remark , the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery . \\nno no . . . \\njust kidding . \\nhad you going there for a moment , didn\\'t i ? \\nin all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games . \\nthe first movie ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth ( and it\\'s 5 billion inhabitants ) . \\nthe mortals won , and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth . \\nunfortunately , shao khan was a poor loser , and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway , ready to take over the planet , as our heroes assumed a fighting stance . \\nthe first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who are fans of the game . \\ni\\'d even go so far as to say that many folks who didn\\'t know about the game probably enjoyed the movie . \\nthe writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself , and they didn\\'t try to overachieve . \\nthere were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot . \\nand , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box office . \\nmortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off , with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie . \\nshao khan has decided that he\\'s going to take over the earth * anyways * , and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament . \\nthereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain stupid . \\none gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought \" hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now . \" \\ntoo bad they didn\\'t simply stick with the formula from the first movie . \\ni could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture , but here are the high points : \\n * the acting is truly bad . \\nsandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie ) . \\n * in one of the worst pieces of mis-casting i think i\\'ve * ever * seen , james remar plays raiden , the god of thunder . \\nin the first movie , christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke : a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics . \\ni generally like it when actors are cast against type ( tim \" tiny \" lister , jr . being cast as the president of the u . s . in the fifth element , for example ) , and remar has always been one of my favorite \" utility \" actors but he\\'s so totally wrong for this part that he doesn\\'t even have the luxury of amused self-awareness . \\n * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important , but then never seen again . \\n * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks , including a muddled scene where liu kang ( robin shou ) seeks out nightwolf ( litefoot ) , has a mystical hallucination , and then wanders off with jade ( irina pantaeva ) . \\nfor these reasons ( and many others ) , i can only give the movie a 2 . . . \\n . . . unless you\\'re a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie . \\nin that case , the following critiques also apply : \\n * sandra hess , while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson ( who played sonya blade in the first movie ) , is much more convincing as a fighter . \\nwilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer . \\nhess looks like she actually knows some martial arts , and puts together a much more believable fight scene . \\n * in the fights , each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game ( and often more ) . \\nsonya does her \" kiss of death , \" jax does his \" earthquake , \" liu kang does his \" animality , \" and so on . \\na big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely . \\n * there aren\\'t as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first , because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between . \\nsilly , silly folks . \\nand the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud-wrestling match . \\nlame and so obviously sexist even i ( politically incorrect , for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon it . \\n * the special effects are generally better , except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their \" animalities . \" \\nmotaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie . \\nfor folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games , i give this a 5 . \\nyou\\'ll probably like it , but not nearly as much as you liked the first one . \\n', b'that\\'s exactly how long the movie felt to me . \\nthere weren\\'t even nine laughs in nine months . \\nit\\'s a terrible mess of a movie starring a terrible mess of a man , mr . hugh grant , a huge dork . \\nit\\'s not the whole oral-sex/prostitution thing ( referring to grant , not me ) that bugs me , it\\'s the fact that grant is annoying . \\nnot just adam sandler-annoying , we\\'re talking jim carrey-annoying . \\nsince when do eye flutters and nervous smiles pass for acting ? \\nbut , on the other hand , since when do really bad slapstick ( a fistfight in the delivery room culminating in grant\\'s head in joan cusack\\'s lap--a scene he paid $60 to have included in the movie ) and obscene double entendres ( robin williams , the obstetrician , tells grant\\'s pregnant girlfriend she has \" a big pussy , \" referring of course to the size of the cat hairs on her coat , but nonetheless , grant paid $60 to have the exchange included in the movie ) pass for comedy ? \\nnine months is a predictable cookie-cutter movie with no originality in humor or plot . \\nhugh grant plays a successful child psychiatrist . \\nwhy a child psychologist ? \\nso the scriptwriters could inject the following unfunny exchange : \\nkid : my dad\\'s an asshole . \\ngrant ( flutters eyelashes , offers a nervous smile , then responds in his annoying english accent and i-think-i-actually-have- talent attitude ) : could you possibly elaborate on that ? \\nkid : my dad\\'s a _huge_ asshole . \\nmore like a hugh asshole , but that\\'s beside the point , which is : nine months includes too many needlessly stupid jokes that get laughs from the ten year olds in the audience while everyone else shakes his or her head in disbelief . \\nso , anyway , grant finds out his girlfriend is pregnant and does his usual reaction ( fluttered eyelashes , nervous smiles ) . \\nthis paves the way for every possible pregnancy/child birth gag in the book , especially since grant\\'s equally annoying friend\\'s wife is also pregnant . \\nthe annoying friend is played by tom arnold , who provides most of the cacophonous slapstick , none of which is funny , such as a scene where arnold beats up a costumed \" arnie the dinosaur \" ( you draw your own parallels on that one ) in a toy store . \\nthe only interesting character in the movie is played by jeff goldblum , who should have hid himself away somewhere after the dreadful hideaway , as an artist with a fear of ( and simultaneous longing for ) commitment . \\nnot even robin williams , who plays a russian doctor who has recently decided to switch from veterinary medicine to obstetrics , has much humor . \\nhis is a one-joke character-- the old foreign-guy-who-mispronounces-english stereotype ( did someone say yakov smirnov ? \\nthat\\'s my favorite vodka , by the way ) , hence the line \" now it\\'s time to take a look at your volvo , \" another nasty but unamusing joke , except this one goes right over the ten year olds\\' heads , while the adults simultaneously groan . \\nnine months is a complete failure , low on laughs and intelligence and high on loud , unfunny slapstick , failed jokes and other uninspired lunacy . \\nhugh grant\\'s sunset boulevard arrest ( please , no caught-with-his-pants-down jokes ) may bring more people into the theaters , but they certainly won\\'t leave with a smile on their faces , not after 90 minutes of grant\\'s nervous smiles . \\neverything in the movie is so forced , so unauthentic that anyone with an i . q . \\nover 80 ( sorry , hugh ) will know they wasted their money on an unfulfilled desire . \\nbut at least they didn\\'t spend 60 bucks for it . \\n', b'play it to the bone , the newest addition to ron shelton\\'s sports - themed repertoire fails in numerous ways . \\nlike most of shelton\\'s other great films ( bull durham , white men can\\'t jump ) , this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots . \\nshelton\\'s films are not considered sports films , but they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story . \\nshelton has been so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races living in various different regions . \\nplay it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull , but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse . \\nthe film has no social message like its predecessors . \\nthe relationship between the friends , two failed boxers who must face off against each other in the ring for 50 thousand dollars , is very confusing for a number of reasons . \\nthe whole film , since it is primarily a \" buddy picture , \" depends on the strength of the friendship the two characters have for each other . \\nunfortunately , it is a very weak bond for the reasons listed below . \\n1 ) we never see how cesar ( antonio banderas ) and vince ( woody harrelson ) meet . \\nthe two are so different from each other , that a scene of how this odd friendship developed should have been mandatory . \\n2 ) vince and cesar argue every moment possible on their trip to las vegas . \\nthere is not one convincing moment dedicated to seeing the characters laugh together or actually agree on something . \\n3 ) the third character on the trip , grace ( lolita davidovich ) stands in the way . \\nshe is in nearly every scene with them , making it impossible to understand the difficulty the two male characters are going to have when they fight each other . \\n4 ) there are two many interfering , irrelevant side stories . \\nvince is convinced that he sees jesus on a regular basis , cesar yells at the sky in spanish when he is angry , and grace tries to sell her inventions to hotel owner robert wagner . \\nthese boring tales only hurt the central plot . \\n5 ) when it comes to time for the two men to fight , they don\\'t even hesitate to pound each other . \\nwasn\\'t the whole point of the road trip to show that these two are friends who could never hurt each other ? \\nby the time the road trip part of the movie is over with , the film wants to be over . \\nshelton , on the other hand , continues to tell his story . \\nforty five painful minutes remain . \\nthe boxing scene between cesar and vince starts out very powerful and interestingly different from other boxing movies . \\nhowever , the fight goes on for way too long and becomes very repetitive and predictable after awhile , kind of like the whole film . \\n', b' \" knock off \" is exactly that : a cheap knock off of an action movie . \\nit\\'s also the worst movie i have seen thus far this year . \\ni figured it would be at least a couple of months before i saw the worst film of 1998 , but alas , it has already been found . \\njean-claude van damme stars as ( i think ) a designer jeans executive who discovers his half-brother has been supplying him with cheaper goods . \\nrob schneider plays van damme\\'s partner , and rochon plays . . . \\nactually , i have no idea who rochon was supposed to be . \\nshe just sort of popped up halfway through without an explanation as to why she was there . \\nmany things are not explained in this film , but i do know that for some bizarre reason , van damme seemed to be doing a jackie chan impression throughout the flick . \\nwhere chan comes off as endearing in his \" normal guy \" character seen in many of his films , van damme just comes off as a wimp . \\nwe\\'re never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions . \\nto be more clear : i did not even know who he was supposed to be until about an hour into the movie , and even then , it was not made too clear . \\nthe film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong . \\ntsui hark ( who directed van damme\\'s last movie , the bad , but not nearly as bad as this , \" double team \" ) never lets the camera rest for a second , and that\\'s no exaggeration . \\nwe are even treated to a five second shot from the point of view of van damme\\'s foot entering a shoe . \\nfabulous ! \\nseriously , though , i have no problem with directors who want to play around with film conventions , as long as they don\\'t get carried away . \\nfor example , look at sam raimi . \\n \" army of darkness \" , one of his best movies , features some of the most inventive camera work i have ever seen , but raimi never lets the special effects get in the way of story . \\nthat\\'s a concept that tsui can\\'t seem to grasp . \\nthe special effects and outrageous camera angles * rule * \" knock off \" to the point where the audience doesn\\'t have a clue as to what\\'s happening any more . \\nanother problem with the film is that it looks cheap . \\nthe film stock used is of such low caliber that i thought i was watching one of those chinese films shown really late at night . \\nand for some inexplicable reason , everyone\\'s voice seems to have been dubbed . \\neven the stars . \\nand even the special effects , seemingly the only aspect of the film the director actually cared about , are inconsistent . \\nfor example , there is a scene in which van damme drives a car out of a window . \\nthe car slams into the ground , and the left wheel is completely destroyed . \\nseconds later , the car drives off at full speed . \\nhey , i have no problem suspending my disbelief in an action movie , but a line must be drawn somewhere . \\nfinally , the acting . \\nnobody gives a good performance in this film . \\nvan damme , an actor i usually like , is way off the mark playing \" everyman \" . \\nand schneider , here to provide comic relief i assume , is totally unfunny and over acts his way through every scene . \\neven the usually solid paul sorvino gives a terribly over-the-top performance as . . . \\nonce again , i have no idea who he was supposed to be . \\nin case i haven\\'t yet made it clear enough , \" knock off \" is the worst movie of van damme\\'s career and possibly the worst movie of the decade . \\nand it\\'s not even one of those movies that\\'s so bad it\\'s funny . \\nit\\'s too inept to be funny . \\nthere are no redeeming factors in \" knock off \" and i seriously hope that every print of this film is burned to a crisp and that somehow my memory of watching the film can be erased . \\n', b\"forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects . \\nset in 1692 at salem , massachusetts , the crucible opens with a group of teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around a boiling cauldron in the middle of a forest under the glow of a full moon . \\nthey beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells . \\nthen one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes . \\nnot to be outdone in her quest to regain the attention of john proctor ( daniel day lewis ) , abigail ( winona ryder ) suddenly seizes a chicken , beats it against the ground and smears her face and lips with the fresh blood . \\ntaking even adolescent hormone surges into account , surely this chicken-bashing bit is a bit excessive , especially for prim puritan sensibilities ? \\nsurely to the puritan eye this is as close to a coven of witches as it gets ? \\nthe crucible errs from the beginning and arthur miller's name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen adaptation of his play . \\nthis is far from a harmless event , a bad start to an already shaky morality tale . \\nthe play describes the film's opening scene during tense exchanges that makes one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply , and this adds to the play's charged atmosphere . \\nin the film , the opening scene becomes an unintentional pandora's box . \\nnot only is credulity stretched but abigail's obsession is unfortunately spotlighted . \\nit positions the crucible more as a cautionary fable about obsessive and malevolent women than against witch hunts ; it will bring back the memory of a rabbit boiling away in a pot . \\nnot surprisingly , the nighttime forest frenzy does not go unnoticed and when two girls fail to wake the following morning , witches are invoked by those eager to blame . \\nwhen the girls are questioned , their confession of guilt is accompanied with an announcement of their return to god and they are thereafter converted to immaculate witnesses , led lustfully by abigail . \\nwith alarming synchronicity our hormonally-advantaged girls zealously gesture and point accusing fingers at innocents , constant reminders that abigail's passion sets all this into inexorable motion . \\nabigail seizes on this opportunity to rid herself of her rival for john proctor's love , his wife elizabeth ( joan allen ) , by including her among those accused of witchcraft . \\nappropriately narrow-waisted and equipped with a distractingly white smile ( watch his teeth deteriorate much too quickly to a murky yellow ) , day lewis plays the dashing moral hero with an over-earnestness that longs to be watched . \\ndirector nicholas hytner is guilty of encouraging day lewis' foaming-mouth fervour with shots where we stare up at proctor as if he was mounted on a pedestal for our admiration . \\notherwise , hytner's direction is unremarkable . \\nryder's performance as abigail is as consistent as her mood swings . \\nher fits of frenzy are energetic enough but the quieter moments are less successful . \\nabigail supposedly revels in her newfound power , but ryder fails at being convincingly haughty although there is much haughtiness to spare here . \\npaul scofield is fine as the overzealous judge danforth , but the incessant moral posturings of all the characters along with the recurrent histrionics of the young girls pricks at the nerves . \\nprobably because she is the only refuge of restraint amidst all the huffing and puffing , allen's elizabeth comes out as the most sympathetic character . \\na scene near the end featuring a private conversation between the imprisoned elizabeth and john is undeniably powerful because for once we are given a reprieve from the moral bantering and the human consequences are revealed . \\nunfortunately , when john's audience again increases to more than one his urge to pontificate returns and the human urgency of his situation is lost . \\nit is clear that miller meant well but i do wish he did it with more delicacy and fewer diversions . \\nhis screenplay is an imperfect creature with the distractions coming out as loud as the message . \\nthe result is a clumsy muddle - i felt like the chicken from the opening scene , head ceaselessly banged with piousness too heavy-handed to be wholly believable . \\nwhen the gallows beckoned , it was sweet release indeed . \\nfar from bewitching , the crucible tests the patience . \\n\", b'i wish i could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion of a sports film . \\ni bet it was some hotshot warner brothers agent with an dark armani suit and manicured fingernails saying , \" it would be a very light comedic version of any given sunday , and we could throw in the hoosiers angle with the casting of gene hackman as the tough but determined coach . \\nthrow in that hunk of a guy keanu reeves and a cast of wacky characters and poof ! \\nwe\\'ll have a hit on our hands ! \" \\nthe replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film , a mishmash collage of one-dimensional characters , rampant stereotypes of cultures and races , cliched emotional statements of purpose , and keanu reeves wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography . \\nthe story is loosely based around the pro football players\\' strike in 1987 and a rag-tag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for a variety of teams with names like the washington sentinels . \\nkeanu reeves stars as shane falco , a has-been football college player looking for redemption . \\ngene hackman dons a fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in hoosiers . \\nrounding out the cast includes swingers\\' jon favreau , 7-up pitchman orlando jones , gruff owner jack warden , and cast of wacky and unknown actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped characters : the drunken welshman , the overweight sumo wrestler , the black convict , the violent cop , and the dumb , dumb cheerleaders . \\nthis bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays , gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is , keanu reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the football field , and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls from coyote ugly look like waitresses from denny\\'s . \\nthe usual things happen like clockwork . \\nthe hero rises from the ashes of failure , the team comes together in unity , the hero falls in love with a conventional love interest , the football games are won with enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and clap , and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night movies on cinemax . \\nit\\'s also a shame when decent directors with good movies under their belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks . \\nhoward deutch , who was behind the camera for two of the best films of \\'80s - pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful , has since been doing grumpier old men and caroline in the city episodes . \\nobviously the problem is that without a good script , any director will fail in the end . \\nsports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory , gritty tales involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds , the rise and fall of gallant heroes , and stories of dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life . \\nthe replacements offers none of this . \\n', b'call it a road trip for the walking wounded . \\nstellan skarsg ? rd plays such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that it\\'s difficult to spend nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly , boozed-out presence . \\nyet this ever-reliable swedish actor adds depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen , a sentimental and painfully mundane european drama . \\nplaywright august strindberg built his career on families and relationships paralyzed by secrets , unable to express their longings until the hour is far too late . \\nthat\\'s an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for , focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father , tomas ( skarsg ? rd ) and his alienated , openly hostile yuppie daughter , kaisa ( lena headey , gossip ) . \\nthey haven\\'t spoken in years , and wouldn\\'t even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen , scotland by automobile if it weren\\'t for kaisa\\'s mother ( charlotte rampling , under the sand ) rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer . \\nin a soap opera twist , mother has only a few days to live . \\n ( only in the movies , right ? ) \\ntoo blitzed to even step foot on a plane , tomas hits the open road with kaisa . \\nloathing each other all the while , they make periodic stops for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out -- whenever he isn\\'t muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be . \\ndespite his sloshed viewpoint , tomas recognizes that the apple hasn\\'t fallen very far from the tree . \\nkaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke , sabotages her personal relationships through indifference , and is unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper . \\nain\\'t they a pair ? \\nunable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the one-note and repetitively bitchy dialogue , screenwriters kristin amundsen and hans petter moland fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events forward -- lost money , roving street hooligans looking for drunks to kick around , nosy cops , and flat tires all figure into the schematic and convenient narrative . \\nby the time they reach the hospital , it\\'s time to unveil the secrets from a dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the father-daughter conflict , they\\'re also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe . \\nthis revelation exists purely for its own sake . \\naberdeen doesn\\'t know where else to go . \\nweak , unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of kaisa . \\nif lena headey were a stronger actress , perhaps aberdeen could have been able to coast on the performances and moody , haunting cinematography ( rendering norway into its own pastoral ghost world -- the reference to a certain superior american indie flick intentional ) . \\nheadey\\'s too busy acting , using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of insouciance . \\nif she were paying any attention to skarsg ? rd , maybe she\\'d figure out that doing less can reveal so much more . \\nit\\'s worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001 , jonathan nossiter\\'s captivating signs & wonders . \\nit\\'s not just because skarsg ? rd and rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films ( they\\'re not bound by ceremonial wedlock in aberdeen ) . \\nthe differences in the way their characters were presented is significant . \\nin aberdeen , rampling is a luminous diva , preening and static in her hospital bed . \\ndespite skarsg ? rd\\'s solid performance as tomas , his pathetic drunk is never given much of a chance to emote anything besides catatonic sorrow . \\nthere\\'s genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during their understated confrontations in signs & wonders , allowing them to suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and years of stifled curiosity . \\nnossiter\\'s film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain . \\nif signs & wonders sometimes feels overloaded with ideas , at least it\\'s willing to stretch beyond what we\\'ve come to expect from traditional drama . \\naberdeen is never half so ambitious , content to sleepwalk through the rhythms and timing of other movies . \\nwhen did character driven stories stop paying attention to the complexities of real life ? \\nthe depressing answer can be found in lawrence kasdan\\'s trite but occasionally useful grand canyon , where steve martin\\'s hollywood mogul pronounces , \" all of life\\'s riddles are answered in the movies ! \" \\neven foreign films are taking that advice to heart . \\n', b' \" party camp , \" is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies i\\'ve seen in awhile . \\na late rip-off of the \" meatballs \" series , the film follows a group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk . \\nthat\\'s really about all that can be said about the \" plot \" because nothing much happens , except that the main character , wise-cracking jerry ( andrew ross ) , has the hots for a cute blonde ( kerry brennan ) , and there is a big contest in the climax . \\nhow fun ! \\nsince , \" party camp , \" has practically no screenplay and there is no talent at all involved , the least the makers could have done was make it raunchy and exploitative . \\nit\\'s not that i think exploitation is necessarily a good quality , but when you are talking about a dull turkey like this , the least that could have been done would be to fill it with a lot of mindless sex . \\neven a psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick . \\nat least , then , it wouldn\\'t have been such a chore to sit through . \\nnever before have i seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat . \\nthe comedy was easy to spot , but it wasn\\'t the least bit funny . \\nit was groan-inducing . \\nconstantly throghout , i was asking myself if director gary graver actually thought this movie was worth anything . \\nso what saves , \" party camp , \" from the dreaded zero star rating ? \\nwell , that\\'s simple : jewel shepard , as a flighty bimbo , was admittedly fun to watch . \\nalthough nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash , at least if the film had centered on shepard , she might have been able to add a little spice to an otherwise rancid , low-budget teen comedy . \\n', b'i\\'ve noticed something lately that i\\'ve never thought of before . \\npseudo- substance - hollywood faking deep meanings in their films . \\nhave you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed , then when you look back , you realize there was something missing ? \\nmore and more , filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed , melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being a great film , but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience , you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff . \\ni\\'m not trying to say city of angels is that bad . \\nit had a lot going for it , but somewhere along the way , it faltered . \\nsomehow , underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all , there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography . \\nthe predictable ending that shattered our hopes ( even though we saw it coming ) only added to the disappointment . \\nbut for over an hour , city of angels is well worth the time . \\nnicolas cage is seth , a guardian angel who , like hundreds ( likely thousands or even millions ) of other angels , spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality ; humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life . \\nmeg ryan , in her most subdued performance yet , plays maggie , a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is we\\'re fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive . \\nafter losing a patient on the surgery table , these questions envelope maggie , and seth , the angel who was there to oversee the patient\\'s transition into the afterlife , is immediately captivated by the doctor . \\nhe begins following and observing maggie , falling more and more in love with her everyday . \\nangels , who we quickly learn are not and never were humans , can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch , but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire . \\nseth\\'s adoration is too much to resist , and eventually he does appear to maggie , quite regularly , although such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community . \\nthe angels are interestingly presented , all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities , but it\\'s a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness . \\ncage is a wonderfully versatile actor ( think face/off , raising arizona , and it could happen to you - what a combo ! ) who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once . \\nit\\'s nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire . \\nthe two aren\\'t very comparable to each other , but they both deviate from her usual \" intelligently ditzy \" romantic comedy roles , and it\\'s an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy . \\nbut even though the two leads do an impressive job , it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of a hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye . \\nit\\'s a shame that with so much going for it , city of angels falters so much in its final stages , leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there , they just didn\\'t know quite how to get to it . \\nthey struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high . \\nfilmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on , remember , and convey to others thru word of mouth , so after telling us for 60+ minutes that this film is a glorious masterpiece , they sure leave us with a disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths . \\nbased on the german film wings of desire ( that being the english title , of course ) , city of angels is ninety percent success , enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings , even the devastatingly disappointing ending . \\nmost movie goers , the non-cynics anyway , will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which needs to be criticized . \\nnonetheless , city of angels is beautifully captivating , which is probably enough to satisfy those poetic viewers who will appreciate a delve into rich emotional territories . \\n', b' \" quest for camelot \" is warner bros . \\' first feature-length , fully-animated attempt to steal clout from disney\\'s cartoon empire , but the mouse has no reason to be worried . \\nthe only other recent challenger to their throne was last fall\\'s promising , if flawed , 20th century fox production \" anastasia , \" but disney\\'s \" hercules , \" with its lively cast and colorful palate , had her beat hands-down when it came time to crown 1997\\'s best piece of animation . \\nthis year , it\\'s no contest , as \" quest for camelot \" is pretty much dead on arrival . \\neven the magic kingdom at its most mediocre -- that\\'d be \" pocahontas \" for those of you keeping score -- isn\\'t nearly as dull as this . \\nthe story revolves around the adventures of free-spirited kayley ( voiced by jessalyn gilsig ) , the early-teen daughter of a belated knight from king arthur\\'s round table . \\nkayley\\'s only dream is to follow in her father\\'s footsteps , and she gets her chance when evil warlord ruber ( gary oldman ) , an ex-round table member-gone-bad , steals arthur\\'s magical sword excalibur and accidentally loses it in a dangerous , booby-trapped forest . \\nwith the help of hunky , blind timberland-dweller garrett ( carey elwes ) and a two-headed dragon ( eric idle and don rickles ) that\\'s always arguing with itself , kayley just might be able to break the medieval sexist mold and prove her worth as a fighter on arthur\\'s side . \\n \" quest for camelot \" is missing pure showmanship , an essential element if it\\'s ever expected to climb to the high ranks of disney . \\nthere\\'s nothing here that differentiates \" quest \" from something you\\'d see on any given saturday morning cartoon -- subpar animation , instantly forgettable songs , poorly-integrated computerized footage . \\n ( compare kayley and garrett\\'s run-in with the angry ogre to herc\\'s battle with the hydra . \\ni rest my case . ) \\neven the characters stink -- none of them are remotely interesting , so much that the film becomes a race to see which one can out-bland the others . \\nin the end , it\\'s a tie -- they all win . \\nthat dragon\\'s comedy shtick is awfully cloying , but at least it shows signs of a pulse . \\nat least fans of the early-\\'90s tgif television line-up will be thrilled to find jaleel \" urkel \" white and bronson \" balki \" pinchot sharing the same footage . \\na few scenes are nicely realized ( though i\\'m at a loss to recall enough to be specific ) , and the actors providing the voice talent are enthusiastic ( though most are paired up with singers who don\\'t sound a thing like them for their big musical moments -- jane seymour and celine dion ? ? ? ) . \\nbut one must strain through too much of this mess to find the good . \\naside from the fact that children will probably be as bored watching this as adults , \" quest for camelot \" \\'s most grievous error is its complete lack of personality . \\nand personality , we learn from this mess , goes a very long way . \\n', b' \" the blair witch project \" was perhaps one of a kind , a unique film that played completely on its own merit , managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses . \\nits success made a sequel inevitable , but this is not the sequel , i suspect , anyone much wanted . \\nafter the release of \" the blair witch project \" , tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville , in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch . \\nlocals have turned this mass hysteria into a great business opportunity , selling twig-sculptures , stones and dirt like those in the movie , and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn , shouting , \" get out of these woods and go home ! \\nthere is no goddamned blair witch ! \" . \\njeff ( ) is one of those people , who has used the sudden popularity of the small town to his advantage . \\nafter he got released from the mental institution , he created a mobile business that attracts thousands of customers through the internet . \\nas the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods , on the \" blair witch hunt \" . \\namong the five strangers is stephen and his girlfriend , the pregnant tristen , who are writing a book on the hysteria caused by the film called \" the blair witch : history or hysteria ? \" , and kim , who dresses in black and has some psychic powers . \\nthe last member of the crew is erica , a young beautiful witch-wannabe , who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore , saying \" the first rule of wicca is , do no harm , because whatever you do will come back to you threefold . \" \\nthis strange group plunges into the woods , where they begin to argue about their different approaches to the experience . \\non the very first night that they decide to spend under the stars amidst the ruins of parr\\'s abandoned house , strange things start happening . \\nwhen they wake up their equipment is gone and only the tapes remain . \\nafter a while they discover strange markings on their bodies . \\nthey are somehow lost in time , as it loops uncontrollably back and forth . \\nthey are all haunted by hallucinations and horrible nightmares and soon they can not see the difference between dreams and reality . \\nthe only thing that they are sure of is that they have brought something or someone with them from the woods . . \\ndocumentary director joe berlinger ( \" paradice lost \" ) helms \" blair witch 2 \" , leaving the creators of the first film ( dan myrick and ed sanches ) in the background . \\nthe opening scenes--the documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film-- is a more promising approach , because instead of trying to cover similar ground , it goes outside the first film and makes its own stand . \\nbut soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked by its own story , that is never resolved and ends with a very anticlimaxic epilogue . \\nin a way , this is a typical hollywood sequel . \\nmore money has been spent and more people have worked on a project that was doomed to fail . \\nthe horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated . \\nof course in these situations , quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical values . \\nfrom its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloody-red forest , with carter burwell\\'s ( \" being john malkovich \" and \" fargo \" ) musical score in the background , you realize that with the exception of its title , this film has absolutely nothing to do with \" the blair witch project \" . \\n \" blair witch . . \" \\nwas filmed by handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting that was mostly based on improvisation . \\nin the sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection , creating a completely different atmosphere . \\nwith its graceful cinematography , production design and flashy editing , the film has a very polished look , which is impossible to associate with the first installment . \\nand though berlinger directs his film with an energy and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body a couple of times , he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor . \\nthe key is simplicity . \\n \" blair witch project \" had a story which was incredibly simple . \\nthat allowed the audience to fill the gaps with our own imagination . \\nthe film was practically an empty screen , on which we projected our most frightening nightmares . \\nthe effect was incredibly powerful , lasting and entir e everyone , but in a different way . \\n \" book of shadows \" feels incredibly controlled and restrict . \\nhere , very little is left to our imagination and the story is so complex and \" clever \" that the screenwriters are the first to get lost in it . \\nthere is is no book of shadows and no conclusion that we can be satisfied with . \\nthis is simply a less artistic film that doesn\\'t have the talent and originality of its predecessor . \\nit resorts to fancy cinematography and special effects to create the right effect and doesn\\'t always succeed . \\nbut most importantly : it stands on its own ground and has almost no connection with the first movie , which doesn\\'t allow it to destroy the original . \\nin the end , i can\\'t call it a bad effort . \\nit\\'s less artistic , not so scary and less original , but certainly not bad . \\nit\\'s simply different . \\nin fact , if you haven\\'t seen \" the blair witch project \" , you might like this film for what it is -- a cross between \" the blair witch project \" and the \" scream \" -films . \\nthe only element that remains constant and similar between the two films is the solid acting ( jeffrey donovan and tristine skyler should be mentioned ) and incredible sense of surrealism . \\nbut it\\'s a common knowledge and experience that , with a few exceptions , every movie sequel is worse than the original and some are even not worth making . \\nto me the story of \" the blair witch project \" seemed completed , but there are obviously no limits to commercial success that \" the book of shadows \" is certainly assured . \\nand it\\'s already time to look forward to \" blair witch 3 \" . \\n', b'when it comes to the average teenage romantic comedy , i expect negative reviews from critics left and right . \\npredictable , unoriginal , and forgettable will most likely be the three adjectives to haunt the down to you\\'s and the drive me crazy\\'s released by the dozens these last couple of years . \\nwhat i really look for in this kind of movie is the entertainment value while i\\'m sitting in the theater . \\nam i enjoying myself ? \\nis this a comfortable break from my week of finals ? \\nthis is why i have given films like final destination or road trip high marks ; i had a party of a time wasting my money on something i won\\'t remember next week . \\nso last week i opened up the new york times - and , no surprise , boys and girls got a negative review . \\ndaily news ? \\nnegative . \\nreelviews ? \\nnegative . \\nepinions . com ? \\nnegative . \\nthis was nothing new . \\namerican pie , final destination , road trip didn\\'t get such hot reviews and i loved those guilty pleasures . \\nsame goes for she\\'s all that , a formulaic but enjoyable pygmalion adaptation that got unjustly pounded . \\nsince boys and girls reunites she\\'s all that director robert iscove and actor freddie prinze jr . , i predicted d ? j ? vu al over again . \\nbut , still curious , i asked around my school and from the one or two people who had seen it , the reactions were far from positive . \\ni had made up my mind ; i\\'ll catch it on video or cable in a couple of years . \\nbut , soon after , following a series of unexpected events ( we couldn\\'t get into shaft because it is rated r ) , i found myself watching boys and girls . \\nwhoops . \\nboys and girls is about a \" nerdy , smart \" boy named ryan ( prinze jr . ) and a \" popular , flirt \" girl named jennifer ( claire forlani ) . \\nbriefly meeting as pre-teens and now attending the same college , the two bump into each other so many times that eventually they become best friends . \\nbut in the movies , a male and a female cannot be friends without having that nagging feeling of attraction for each other . \\nwith advice from their roommates ( amanda detmer , jason biggs ) , ryan and jennifer attempt to discover the true meaning of their relationship . \\nthe film definitely lives up to the dreaded three adjectives - and mindless entertainment is nowhere to be found . \\ni could hardly sit through the 93 minute running time for several reasons . \\nthe dialogue is probably the worst i have ever seen in any movie , mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring script and the ridiculous words these characters use is what hollywood thinks kids can relate to . \\nit is almost offensive . \\nan example of an insightful conversation : \\n \" you\\'re dumb . \\ndumb , dumb , dumb , dumb . \" \\n \" no . \" \\n ( followed by a mandy moore-esque tune background ) \\n ( well it\\'s not as bad as wing commander i guess ) \\nthe supporting cast is also painfully useless . \\ndetmer and biggs stand in the way for anything interesting to happen with their own boring , pointless subplots . \\nand although this is supposed to be from both perspectives of the human sex , prinze jr\\'s ryan dominates the screen while forlani\\'s jennifer simply acts as a dilemma for him to work with . \\nwe never learn anything about jennifer which is a shame too because forlani is the only actor to bring any life into her character . \\nteenager or not : you\\'ll hate this movie , i guarantee it . \\nmaybe i should rent she\\'s all that again . \\nis it really as good as i think it is ? \\n', b\"sydney lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality . \\nhe is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades , like twelve angry men , serpico or the verdict . \\nbut , in the same time , almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers that hamper lumet's reputation . \\na stranger among us , 1992 rip-off of peter weir's witness , belongs to the latter category . \\nthe heroine of this movie is emily eden ( melanie griffith ) , tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york . \\nduring one of such actions , her partner nick ( jamey sheridan ) got hurt and as a result , she becomes depressed . \\nin order to help her recover , bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community . \\nemily starts investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder . \\nconcluding that the perpetrator belongs to community , she decides to go undercover . \\nthat isn't easy , because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways . \\nthings get even more complicated when she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel ( eric thal ) . \\nusing peter weir's formula isn't the greatest flaw of this film . \\neven the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to the certain extent . \\nbut the worst insult to viewer's audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith . \\nthe author of this review never liked this actress very much , but she was at least tolerable in some of her roles . \\nrole of emily eden , unfortunately , isn't one of them . \\nfirst of all , she can't pass for tough nypd street fighter , and her attempt to pass for orthodox jewish woman isn't much better . \\nscreenplay by robert j . avrech makes things even worse with some formulaic red herring subplots ( scene involving two italian gangsters was almost too painful to watch ) . \\nbut , on the other hand , other actors are more convincing ( lee richardson as an old rabbi , thal as ariel and charming mia sara as his intended bride ) , and the photography by andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth when the scenes take place in hassidic community . \\nalso , the film might educate viewers about hassidic culture . \\nthat is the only thing that prevents it from turning into total waste of time . \\n\", b'so ask yourself what \" 8mm \" ( \" eight millimeter \" ) is really all about . \\nis it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy , sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography ? \\nis it about the business itself , how , bubbling just beneath the surface of big-town americana , there\\'s a sordid world of sick and depraved people who won\\'t necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires ? \\nor is it about those who can , those who are in a position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see ? \\ni\\'m not talking about snuff films , supposed \" documentaries \" of victims being brutalized and killed on camera . \\ni\\'m talking about films like \" 8mm \" and its director , joel schumacher . \\nwith a recent run of big budget movies to his credit-- \" batman & robin , \" \" a time to kill , \" \" batman forever , \" \" the client \" --schumacher certainly has that kind of influence . \\nis \" 8mm \" something you really want to see ? \\nprobably not . \\nthe first two-thirds of \" 8mm \" unwind as a fairly conventional missing persons drama , albeit with a particularly unsavory core . \\nthen , as it\\'s been threatening all along , the film explodes into violence . \\nand just when you think it\\'s finally over , schumacher tags on a ridiculous self-righteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further . \\ntrust me . \\nthere are better ways to waste two hours of your life . \\nnicolas \\' \" snake eyes \" \\' cage plays private investigator tom welles who is hired by a wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whether a reel of film found in her late husband\\'s safe documents a young girl\\'s murder . \\nwelles goes about his assignment rather matter-of-factly , and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly , almost as if you don\\'t need any specialized skills or training to do this . \\nwelles certainly makes it look easy . \\nand cops , obviously , never look in toilet tanks for clues . \\nthe deeper welles digs into his investigation the more obsessed he becomes , like george c . scott in paul schrader\\'s \" hardcore . \" \\noccasionally , a little flickering sound whirs in his head like sprockets winding through a film projector , reminding him of his unpleasant task . \\nthere are hints that this is taking its toll on his lovely wife , played by catherine keener , who is frustrated by her husband spending all of his time in cleveland rather than in their ugly split-level home in harrisburg , pa . \\n \" 8mm \" doesn\\'t condemn or condone its subject matter , it just exploits it . \\nthe irony , of course , is that schumacher and \" seven \" scribe andrew kevin walker\\'s vision of life in the snuff lane is limited by what they can show in an r-rated , first-run hollywood product . \\nso we only see snippets of snuff , and a lot more footage of nicolas cage covering his face in horror . \\nlater it\\'s the turn of joaquin phoenix ( who\\'s quite good and by far the film\\'s most interesting character as adult bookstore flunky max california ) to cover his face as the horrid thing is screened over and over again . \\nall this to get to the familiar yet offensive \" revelation \" that sexual deviants are not , indeed , monsters but everyday people like you and me . \\nneither super nor standard , \" 8mm \" is shocking only in its banality . \\n', b'national lampoon\\'s animal house , made in 1978 and set in 1962 , remains one of the -- no , fuck that noise -- * the * funniest movie ever made . \\nand this isn\\'t just my opinion , either ; everybody knows this , and that\\'s why about a gazillion inferior rip-offs have been made , trying to duplicate its success . \\n ( pcu anyone ? \\nand the first person to bring up glory daze gets decked . ) \\nanimal house takes place at the fictional faber college , circa 1962 , where the omega frat calls the shots . \\nthese guys are wholesome , clean-cut , model-citizens . . . \\ni . e . \\na bunch of assholes . \\ngreg , their leader , is going out with mandy pepperidge , but since the silly bastard doesn\\'t believe in pre-marital sex , their relationship never goes further than a quick jack-off under the stars . \\nneidermeyer is the supreme-bozo of the bunch , walking around with his dick out kicking freshman ass and trying to impress the muff . \\nalso hanging around these losers is babs , future universal studios employee and serious bitch . \\nnow let\\'s just take a peak next door , at the delta house . \\nover here , anything goes : you wanna throw shit out the window ? \\nokay . \\nyou wanna crush a bunch of beer cans on your forehead and pour honey-mustard all over your chest ? \\ngo right ahead . \\nthe frat\\'s leaders are otter and boon ( tim matheson and peter riegert ) . \\notter is the ladies\\' man , going out with another girl every night , and boon is the comedian . \\nhe\\'s got a steady-date , katy ( karen allen ) , but she\\'s sick of playing second-fiddle to a bottle of j . d . \\nthen there are the others : pinto , a wimp ; flounder , a blimp ; d . day , a biker ; stork , who may or may not have brain-damage ; and last but not least . . . \\nbluto ! \\nbluto , played by the late , great john belushi , is the man . \\nhe\\'s the kind of guy who slugs back entire fifths of whiskey then proclaim , \" i needed that . \" \\nthe kind of guy who puts a cream-filled snowball into his mouth , puffs up his cheeks and spits it out , and then says \" i\\'m a zit -- get it ? \" \\nthe story is as follows : the omegas are getting the deltas kicked off campus . \\nthe deltas , knowing that fighting the omegas is stupid , decide to go out with style , throwing a wild toga party and ruining the homecoming parade . \\nthis is the fucnniest movie int he history of the world . \\ndo yourself a favor and go see it . \\n', b'you\\'ve heard all the hype . \\nyou\\'ve seen all their faces - natalie portman ( the professional ) as queen amidala , liam neeson ( schindler\\'s list ) as qui-gon jinn , ewan mcgregor ( trainspotting ) as obi-wan kenobi , and jake lloyd ( jingle all the way ) as young anakin skywalker . \\nif you\\'ve read any reviews , you\\'ve also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy . \\nyou also may have heard that this one\\'s too kiddie-friendly , and doesn\\'t have enough content for adults . \\nbelieve the hype . \\nthe effects are stunning , the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic , the lightsaber duels are amazing , and queen amidala\\'s sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth . \\nbut there\\'s something missing here , and it isn\\'t budget or effects - it\\'s everything money * can\\'t * buy . \\nthe actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad-stroked and flat characters . \\nthe most successful at this is liam neeson who , as qui-gon jinn , a jedi master to young obi-wan kenobi , has quiet dignity and a wise , commanding presence . \\nhe is the anchor to this movie , as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out . \\nportman\\'s queen amidala and mcgregor\\'s obi-wan kenobi don\\'t fare nearly so well . \\namidala , the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation ( ? ! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life ) . \\nand obi-wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he\\'s nothing but a robin to qui-gon jinn\\'s batman . \\nhowever , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity , and he does a good job . \\nhe also absolutely nails alec guiness\\' ( obi-wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise . \\nin fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that\\'s one of the problems with this film . \\ni would never call myself a \" star wars \" fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i\\'ve always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america . \\nhowever , if you are the one person in america who * hasn\\'t * seen the films at all or even recently , or who doesn\\'t bother to brush-up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost . \\nfor example , one of the film\\'s main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine . \\nfor those of you not recently steeped in \" star wars \" trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader\\'s master in \" return of the jedi \" and \" empire strikes back . \" \\nso , obviously , his appearance in \" phantom menace \" is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful . \\na lot of the movie is like that . \\nr2-d2 and c-3po make token appearances , and it\\'s obvious that lucas is banking on the audience\\'s pre-existing fondness for them . . . \\nbecause he doesn\\'t do much to add to it in any way . \\nsame goes for jabba the hutt , who doesn\\'t look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy . \\neven * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) , coruscant ( the cloud city from \" empire strikes back \" ) , and alderaan ( leia\\'s home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in \" star wars \" ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing . \\nwhat\\'s the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ? \\nthe answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty . \\nthere\\'s no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be . \\nanother problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film . \\ni was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters . \\nand jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast . \\nunlike chewbacca and c-3po , who got their humanity ( if you\\'ll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive \" teenage mutant ninja turtles . \" \\nfurthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot . \\noddly , this isn\\'t just * my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids . \\nwell , he\\'s done a good job . \\nthe hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight-year-old boy . \\nthat\\'s not jake lloyd\\'s fault , though - he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him . \\nthat\\'s another mistake , of course , because the cute tyke becomes darth vader . \\nwarning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! ! \\nin my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin\\'s future evil in the film . \\nthe boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks , and there\\'s nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie . \\nhe has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english- language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine . \\nbut the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn\\'t all hearts and roses is yoda\\'s hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui-gon jinn . \\nhis explanation ? \\n \" his future is clouded . \" \\n ( warning : major spoiler ahead . \\nenter at your own risk . ) \\nof course , the noble qui-gon dies at the hand of darth maul , a scary-looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts , but has turned to the dark side . \\nthis dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie , but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double-sided lightsaber , and his scary facial makeup . \\nbecause qui-gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force , obi-wan , qui-gon\\'s young padawan apprentice ( one level below knightdom ) , must take over the training himself . \\nso , at the end of the movie , we end where the saga actually begins - with obi-wan kenobi and his young apprentice , anakin \" darth vader \" skywalker . \\ndid this story need to be told ? \\ni would say no . \\nbut is it a worthwhile movie to see ? \\nabsolutely . \\nif you don\\'t enter the theater with jedi-size expectations , and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle , then this is your movie . \\nthe tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation . \\nthe digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight . \\nand yoda and young obi-wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler , happier time . \\nabove all , this is a fun movie . \\nnot deep , not meaningful , and not profound . \\nbut fun . \\nmaybe next time , lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co-write the script , and the guy who directed \" empire \" will direct . \\nbecause if lucas does the next one himself , it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most - potential . \\n : ) \\n', b\"seen may 31 , 1999 on home video ( rented ) . \\none of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own , everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise . \\nwith some films it might be just a secondary issue , but with `dark city' what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are , which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully-constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie . \\nthere's an old role-playing computer game called `d ? ja v ? ' wherein the player takes on the role of a man who can't remember who he is , where he is and how he got there . \\nthe goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict . \\nthe premise to this film is not unlike that game , only this time we don't have control over the protagonist . \\nwe begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city ( actually , it's more than just the city , it's the whole reality ) that isn't just that neo-gothic look ( a la `batman , ' `blade runner , ' ) , but is so fully developed it's almost a different genre completely . \\nlater he will learn that his name is john murdoch ( sewell ) , but for now he has no idea what's going on other than the fact something is not right . \\nthe fact there's a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious , hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling . \\nthis opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre , horrific tone . \\nthe man doesn't know who he is nor where he's going and it's interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him . \\nin fact , this is the way all stories begin since it's impossible to know the history of a character , their feelings , values , morals , etc . until after we've observed them for a while . \\nbut in this case , the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization , developing the mood and outlining the story . \\neventually , some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police . \\nwe met inspector frank bumstead ( hurt ) , a quiet , unemotional , soft-spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time . \\ntwo other important characters are also introduced : dr . daniel p . schreber ( sutherland ) , a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john's doctor ; and emma murdoch ( connelly ) , a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film-noir movies . \\nit was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film . \\nhe also contacts emma , which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex , mysterious back story . \\nbut absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in `dark city , ' which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo . \\neverything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance - considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot , its lighting , art direction and overall production design , they don't seem to be able to afford any gratuities . \\nhowever , that might also be what's keeping it from reaching its maximum potential . \\nby continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place , so much unlike the real world we know , we come to realize that it's all a hoax . \\neveryone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction . \\nbut , as the film's tagline says , `last night , one of us went off . ' \\nfor reasons that are never clearly explained , it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive ( a process known as `tuning' ) . \\nthe aliens , which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin , also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight . \\nat the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made , they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then . \\nthis premise certainly is interesting and director and co-screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard . \\nhe does provide some explanations such as that dr . schreber is an assistant to `the strangers' because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form . \\nthe aliens mix and match the memories of the city's population to see who will change and who will not . \\nin the process this creates for a good deal of deep , thought-provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world . \\nhowever , where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is . \\nthe main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened , yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant , static and cold ( mediocre performances by hurt and connelly don't help either ) . \\nfor example , john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her , yet in some scenes crucial to the film's plot , we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other , which is also part of the film's climax and ending . \\nand that's what proyas seems to be inferring with the film , but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense . \\nironically , this is what made his first film `the crow' work so well , which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical , dark twisted world . \\nwith `dark city' the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message . \\nstill , the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable . \\nthere's a lot to like here , most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does . \\nthe story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years . \\n`dark city' is what the movies are all about - the escape from the real world . \\n\", b\"the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire-fu copycats . \\nit's not a pretty death , and it's leaving the likes of schwartznager , stallone , and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea . \\nsometimes , the mix results in a mind-blowing spectacle unlike any other . \\nquality action with amazing and exciting stunt work , as in 1999's the matrix , can be a real gem . \\nbut too often hollywood gets it wrong , even when they pay off chinese directors . \\nflying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists . \\nmostly it's laughable . \\nin hollywood's rush to emulate the success of the matrix , trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form . \\nbut iron monkey , the latest asian import , shows us how to get it right . \\niron monkey ( actually a reissue of a 1993 film ) is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante ( rongguang yu ) , fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry . \\nbut it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong fei-hong , most recently seen in one of the most overlooked , and possibly best films of 2000 , drunken master 2 ( released in the u . s . as the legend of drunken master ) . \\nunlike drunken master 2 , which stars jackie chan as an adult fei-hong , iron monkey finds a much younger fei-hong ( sze-man tsang ) and his father wong kei-ying ( yen chi dan ) thrust into the middle of iron monkey's fight against oppression . \\niron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2 . at times , fighting styles , especially that of monkey himself , do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle-toed floating of films like crouching tiger , hidden dragon , director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth . \\niron monkey is at its heart a hardcore , kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger . \\nhowever , there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters , such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his good-hearted but misguided enemy , chief fox . \\nin those moments , and in others , iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience . \\nwhile in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master 2 , iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune . \\naka siunin wong fei-hung tsi titmalau . \\n\", b'what do you get when you slap together a movie based on a story by the legendary george lucas , directed

if you really want to have a good time , check into this movie on the same night as its two sequels , rent a jug of iced coke , truckloads of nachos and salsa , an adventure hat and whip , and prepare to gag yourself into a world of action-movie heaven ! \\nlittle known facts about this film and its stars : this picture was nominated for eight 1981 oscar nominations , including best picture . \\nit lost that award to chariots of fire , but did manage to win for best art direction , best special effects , best film editing and best sound . \\nactor tom selleck was originally cast as indiana jones , but was committed to his hit tv show , \" magnum p . i . \" . \\nin filming the well of souls sequence , the producers scoured every pet shop in london and the south of england for every snake they could lay their hands on . \\nhence there are snakes that are identifiable from many different geographical areas . \\nhowever , once all the snakes were on set , it became clear that there were not nearly enough of them , so spielberg had several hoses cut into lengths , and these were used as well . \\nlooking closely , you can tell which are the real snakes and which are not . \\nan early draft of the script had indy travelling to shanghai to recover a piece of the staff of ra . \\nduring his escape from the museum where it was housed , he sheltered from machine gun fire behind a giant rolling gong . \\nalso in the same script , indy and marion flee the chaos caused by the opening of the ark in a wild mine-cart chase sequence . \\nboth of these scenes were cut from the script , but ended up in 1984\\'s indiana jones and the temple of doom . \\nthis film begins with a shot of a peak in the jungle which is reminiscent of the paramount pictures logo . \\nthe same type of opening is present in its sequels . \\njock\\'s airplane at the beginning of the film has the registration number \" ob-cpo \" . \\nthis is a reference to obi-wan and c-3po from george lucas\\' star wars ( 9 . 5/10 ) . \\nalso , the hieroglyphics in the well of souls include engravings of r2-d2 and c-3po . \\nthey can be seen on a post to the right of indy and sallah as they remove the ark . \\nthe script originally included a long fight between a swordsman and indiana with his whip . \\nas legend has it , actor harrison ford was suffering diarrhea at the time , and asked if the scene could be shortened . \\nspielberg said the only way he could shorten it was if indy pulled out his gun and just shot the guy . \\nthe entire crew laughed and that\\'s how it was filmed . \\nwhen indy first falls in the well of souls and is face to face with the cobra , you can see the snake\\'s reflection on the glass dividing it and harrison ford , also some fingerprints and stuff like that . \\nwhen indy is dragging along the ground , hanging onto the nazi soldier\\'s truck with the ark inside , you can see the pad that he\\'s being dragged on . \\n', b'sometimes a movie comes along that falls somewhat askew of the rest . \\nsome people call it \" original \" or \" artsy \" or \" abstract \" . \\nsome people simply call it \" trash \" . \\na life less ordinary is sure to bring about mixed feelings . \\ndefinitely a generation-x aimed movie , a life less ordinary has everything from claymation to profane angels to a karaoke-based musical dream sequence . \\nwhew ! \\nanyone in their 30\\'s or above is probably not going to grasp what can be enjoyed about this film . \\nit\\'s somewhat silly , it\\'s somewhat outrageous , and it\\'s definitely not your typical romance story , but for the right audience , it works . \\na lot of hype has been surrounding this film due to the fact that it comes to us from the same team that brought us trainspotting . \\nwell sorry folks , but i haven\\'t seen trainspotting so i can\\'t really compare . \\nwhether that works in this film\\'s favor or not is beyond me . \\nbut i do know this : ewan mcgregor , whom i had never had the pleasure of watching , definitely charmed me . \\nhe was great ! \\ncameron diaz\\'s character was uneven and a bit hard to grasp . \\nthe audience may find it difficult to care about her , thus discouraging the hopes of seeing her unite with mcgregor after we are immediately sucked into caring about and identifying with him . \\nmisguided ? \\nyou bet . \\nloveable ? \\nyou bet . \\na life less ordinary was a delight and even had a bonus for me when i realized it was filmed in my hometown of salt lake city , utah . \\nthis was just one more thing i didn\\'t know about this movie when i sat down with a five dollar order of nachos and a three dollar coke . \\nmaybe not knowing the premise behind this film made for a pleasant surprise , but i think even if i had known , i would have been just as happy . \\na life less ordinary is quirky , eccentric , and downright charming ! \\nnot for everyone , but a definite change of pace for your typical night at the movies . \\n', b'hilarious , ultra-low budget comedy from film school dropout kevin smith chronicles a day in the life of two convenience store slackers ( brian o\\'halloran and jeff anderson ) . \\nthey spend most of their day ignoring customers while discussing everything from fellatio to self-fulfillment . \\nthe premise is strictly sitcom and the photography is grainy as all get-out , but you could spend ten times the film\\'s budget ( a reported $27 , 000 ) and still not get dialogue half as good as this . \\noriginally rated nc-17 for language . \\nnot recommended for viewers with sensitive ears . \\nkilling zoe =========== \\nremake reservoir dogs as a french art film and you\\'re halfway to killing zoe , writer/director roger avary\\'s slow-moving story of a failed bastille day bank robbery . \\neric stoltz stars as an american in paris who gets in * way * over his head when hooks up with a band of nihilistic bank robbers . \\nhe\\'s the safecracker who\\'s blissful unaware that the bank job is a botch job from the word go . \\nthough intriguing on all fronts , the film is paced at half the speed of pulp fiction , which avary co-wrote with quentin tarantino . \\nin english and french . \\nthe road to wellville ===================== \\nbased on the novel by t . coraghessan boyle , the road to wellville doesn\\'t go very far . \\nbowels , bowels , and more bowels are explored by dr . john harvey kellogg ( a buck-toothed and bespectacled anthony hopkins ) , who , in the early 1900\\'s , advocated abstinence , vegetarianism , and frequent defecation . \\nhe also invented the cornflake . \\nreally . \\nchecking-in to kellogg\\'s battle creek sanitarium are matthew broderick and bridget fonda , just two of the many well-known faces in this failed comedy . \\nleave your laughter at the door and you can marvel at the unfunny antics of john cusack , michael lerner , lara flynn boyle , john neville , and dana carvey . \\nthe art direction is impeccable and some of the early sequences are amusing , but the novelty quickly wears off as writer/director alan parkers tries his darnedness to turn doo-doo into drama . \\nwhat he ends up with is something that i can\\'t print here . \\nphew ! \\nstargate ======== \\nlawrence of arabia meets star wars . \\nthis epic sci-fi film is more sheer spectacle than anything else . \\ndirector roland emmerich ( universal solider ) shamelessly rips off lucas and spielberg and just about any other cosmic cliche that he can lay his hands on . \\nthe film is overlong , the characters are cardboard , and the script is filled with some of the most laughable details in modern sci-fi history . \\nthat said , there\\'s still plenty to watch here . \\nsci-fi fans should enjoy the sculpted sands , the morphing headdresses , and a surprisingly spunky james spader . \\nhe plays the egyptologist who gets to prove his theory that that \" somebody else \" built the pyramids . \\nless interesting are co-stars kurt russell and jaye davidson of crying game fame . \\nstar trek generations ===================== \\ntrek fans may be more forgiving , but , for the rest of us , the sluggish star trek generations is a mixed bag at best . \\nthe story is interesting , but each scene goes too long . \\nthe cast is earnest , but the direction lacks punch . \\nand so on . \\n ( the best example of the latter is a klingon comeuppance that delivers none of the impact of a similar scene in star trek ii . ) \\noriginal enterprise captain james t . kirk appears on both ends of the story , though they cut the scene where shatner turns to the screen to plead \" get a life . \" \\nremarkably unremarkable . \\nmiracle on 34th street ====================== \\nin a season of the specialist and pulp fiction et al , maybe a remake of miracle on 34th street * is * necessary . \\njohn hughes certainly believes in santa claus and his les mayfield-directed production does nothing to tarnish the memory of the 1947 original . \\nthe romance between costars dylan mcdermott and elizabeth perkins doesn\\'t work too well , but the film makes a strong case that richard attenborough is the definitive kriss kringle . \\nhis chemistry with children can moisten any eye . \\nno claus for alarm . \\njunior ====== \\narnold schwarzenegger pregnant ? \\nsure , billy crystal did it before in rabbit test , but the sight of schwarz with a bulging belly is a casting coup comparable to dustin hoffman in tootsie . \\nwhat should be nothing more than a one-joke premise actually gets better as it goes along . \\ndirector ivan reitman ( dave , twins ) wisely keeps the farce to a minimum , so the first hour moves slower than you might expect . \\ndon\\'t expect too many yuks from danny devito , but you can\\'t beat those early romantic scenes between emma and arnie . \\nhow\\'s * that * for a collision of acting styles ? \\n', b'films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they\\'re about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there\\'s never really been a comic book like from hell before . \\nfor starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid \\'80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . \\nto say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . \\nthe book ( or \" graphic novel , \" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . \\nin other words , don\\'t dismiss this film because of its source . \\nif you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell\\'s directors , albert and allen hughes . \\ngetting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that\\'s set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ? \\nthe ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london\\'s east end . \\nit\\'s a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called \" unfortunates \" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision . \\nwhen the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case . \\nabberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium . \\nupon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it isn\\'t so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can\\'t stomach . \\ni don\\'t think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i won\\'t go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay . \\nin the comic , they don\\'t bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end . \\nit\\'s funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts . \\nand from hell\\'s ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( \" who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star ? \" ) . \\ndon\\'t worry - it\\'ll all make sense when you see it . \\nnow onto from hell\\'s appearance : it\\'s certainly dark and bleak enough , and it\\'s surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) . \\nthe print i saw wasn\\'t completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( don\\'t say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic . \\noscar winner martin childs\\' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place . \\neven the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent . \\nians holm ( joe gould\\'s secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians ) log in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is graham . \\ni cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it actually wasn\\'t half bad . \\nthe film , however , is all good . \\n2 : 00 - r for strong violence/gore , sexuality , language and drug content \\n', b'reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlington rd are the others , each derivative in their own special way ) . \\nthe guy can\\'t seem to write believable dialogue ( sample from reindeer games : \" rule #1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel \" ) , create multi-faceted characters , or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns ( no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely ) . \\nhis screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight . \\ni can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard , \" oh you thought my movie was gonna go here , f * ck you jack ass , take that twist , decipher this mother f * cker ! \" \\nit\\'s almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie . \\nand why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is ? \\nauteur theory be damned ; it\\'s kruger\\'s \" style \" , not the director\\'s that winds up on screen . \\nkruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut \" sometimes less is more \" . \\nand his numerous twists can\\'t even claim to be originals ; arlington rd\\'s ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j . pakula thriller the parallax view , and in reindeer games we get this ol\\' gem ; character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn\\'t know ( pronouns used to protect the gender of the \" character \" . . . grammar \\nbe damned ) . \\n \" how did you know that ? \" \\nthe stunned protagonist asks , suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along . \\n . \\n . \\nsince twist endings are currently so in vogue , and seeing as how kruger\\'s screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending , i guess it\\'s no wonder why he works so frequently . \\nhe\\'s quickly becoming miramax\\'s mickey mouse ; the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects . \\nthis is appropriate considering that miramax ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports ( life is beautiful ) and freddie prinze jr . vehicles . \\ntheir company\\'s current logo could be \" we ride the trends \" . \\nreindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy , a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head . \\nalthough affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness , he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick . \\naffleck is such a puppy dog that it\\'s impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone\\'s bitch . \\nthe role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it ) , the twists so outrageous , and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent \" serious \" movie getting . \\nit may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction , casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy ( who\\'s played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance ) \\njames frain is nick , rudy\\'s cellmate , a manslaughterer who\\'s found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason ( charlize theron ) . \\nashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she\\'s never seen one picture of him . \\nwhich works out fine since the character is killed in a near-riot , and rudy ( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick ) takes his place , which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy ( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape ) and a surprise visit from ashley\\'s brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) , who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co-horts . \\nhe plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who , according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley , used to work as a guard in the indian casino . \\nthough by the end , the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything i\\'ve described might as well be irrelevant . \\nthis is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on ; several scenes in which , after catching his prey , the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid one-liner . \\nincluded : two ( 2 ) scenes of two ( 2 ) different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him ( one following the other no less ) . \\nthough it\\'s an action film , the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on , incredulous as the audience . \\nthe flick was directed by john frankenheimer , a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career , fell off the a-list following a string of flops and now , in his old age , is slowly climbing his way back up . \\nit would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin ( one of those almost but not quite movies ) which followed the island of dr . morneau \\n ( you remember , the one with marlon brando in mime make-up and a not so flattering moo-moo ) , and now this . \\nhe films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain-zapped mtv audience to pick apart . \\nproblem is these action scenes ( nearly all failed escapes ) serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play . \\ncharacter problems abound ; rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre , the latter of which is not ( at least at this point ) something ben affleck is capable of pulling off . \\nthe former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear . \\nbut then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster . \\ncharlize theron , an extraordinary talent , is , like affleck , playing whatever part the script requires her to play , whether it be vulnerability at one moment , anger at the next . \\nshe never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes ( frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this . \\ngary sinise has played this role frequently , and here , as in snake eyes , he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol ( the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more ) , that it becomes more of an annoyance ( oh there he goes again ? ? ? ) than a threat . \\nthese are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience . \\n', b'the law of crowd pleasing romantic movies states that the two leads must end up together by film\\'s end . \\nif you\\'re not familiar with this law , then maybe you\\'ve seen the trailer for this film which shows that the two leads are together by film\\'s end . \\nnow if you\\'re a regular reader of mine , you\\'ve heard me say this countless times : you know how drive me crazy is going to end , but is the journey to get to that ending worth it ? \\nno , it definitely is not . \\nmelissa joan hart ( from abc\\'s \" sabrina , the teenage witch \" ) likes a hunky stud on the basketball team . \\nadrien grenier is her grungy neighbor who\\'s just broken up with his activist girlfriend . \\napparently he wants to make his ex-girlfriend jealous enough to take him back , and she wants someone to take her to the big year end dance . \\nso the two pretend to date for some reason , but only after hart gives grenier a bath to turn him into a hunky stud . \\nwill grenier like his new popularity and turn on his friends ? \\nwill this crazy scheme work ? \\ndo i care ? \\nthe teen comedy resurgence of late has been surprisingly good in terms of comedy . \\nwhat makes movies like can\\'t hardly wait and 10 things i hate about you work ( and to a lesser extent , she\\'s all that and never been kissed ) is because the writers of those films seem to realize that high school is a joke and write their scripts accordingly . \\ni don\\'t know what the writer\\'s intention was with drive me crazy . \\nthere was some smart comedy in those films to make the obvious endings worth getting to . \\nhere there\\'s nothing . . . \\njust teens whining about who\\'s going to take them to the big dance . \\ndo me a favor kids , go get a job or something . . . \\njust shut the hell up . \\nin all honesty , the best part of this film is the end credits . \\nnow normally when i say that it\\'s followed with the joke \" . . . because the movie is finally over . \" \\nin this case though the end credits really are the most entertaining part of the film . \\nafter the obligatory second playing of britney spears\\' titular song , there\\'s a quick commercial jingle for a burger joint the kids in the film hang out in and a brief rendition of the school song for their high school . \\nnothing great , but more entertaining than anything in the 90 minutes which preceded them . \\nsci-fi fans take note : there are brief appearances from stephen collins ( star trek : the motion picture ) and faye grant ( the tv miniseries \" v \" and \" v : the final battle \" ) . \\n[pg-13] \\n', b'on june 30 , 1960 , a self-taught , idealistic , yet pragmatic , young man became , at age 36 , the first head of government of a newly independent african state , formerly the belgian congo . \\ntwo months later , he was ousted from his powerful position and hunted by government troops until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides . \\nthis little-known story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in \" lumumba . \" \\npatrice lumumba\\'s ( eriq ebouaney ) story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary , \" lumumba - death of a prophet , \" virtually guaranteeing that his new , fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject . \\npeck , with co-writer pascal bonitzer , begins at the end of the story of the young political leader . \\nwe watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men . \\nimages of hatchets , saws and fast-emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image . \\njump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian-owned congo . \\na third class postal worker , lumumba , speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes , proclaiming himself not tribal , not regional , but a national leader . \\nhis small , mobile party , the congolese national movement ( mnc ) is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer , and get his face known , in the bustling capital , stanleyville . \\nat a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world , lumumba is in the right place at the right time and , through political savvy and chess-like manipulation , achieves a position of leadership of the mnc . \\nas the date for independence approaches , he tactically positions himself to be the new nation\\'s first prime minister and defense minister , supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) . \\nthe coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country\\'s vast natural resources of copper , diamonds , gold and more . \\nlumumba won\\'t seek the help of the us , knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government . \\nhis initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination . \\nthe situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies , the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves , belgian troops violently intervene , the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad . \\nthis tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes-odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries . \\npeck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba , his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50\\'s and 60\\'s . \\n ( during the time the story takes place , many new nations , including nigeria and somalia , were born , with varying degrees of success and failure , usually dependent upon which country colonized them . \\nsome colonial masters were better than others . ) \\nthe effort involved in \" lumumba \" is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades , if at all . \\nproduction values are first rate on what must be a small , by us standards , budget . \\nthe period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique . \\nthe screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeoman\\'s work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba\\'s life . \\nthe political side of things is evenly told in a linear , straightforward manner that teaches , not preaches . \\nit concentrates on the good deeds of the man , if a bit as a stalwart saint , but doesn\\'t embellish on a larger than life persona . \\nthe family side of patrice\\'s life is handled in several , perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children , embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child . \\ni know the intent is to flesh the man out , but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba . \\nthe story , as such , has a lopsided feel about it . \\nhigh marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character . \\nthe actor gives a convincing , charismatic performance as the multifaceted , politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions . \\nin true docudrama tradition , the supporting cast does not outshine the star , complementing his good efforts , instead . \\n \" lumumba \" is a solid , interesting , educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos , both . \\nit has more intelligence in its telling than anything i\\'ve seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a b+ . \\n', b'when bulworth ended , i allowed myself a sigh of relief : ? it is possible for me to enjoy political satire . ? \\nthere have been several recent political films that didn\\'t do a whole lot for me -- wag the dog , for instance , i found to be an intelligent but heartless film , while primary colors is unbearable and unwatchable in its awfulness . ? \\nbulworth is a far better film than these , both in its execution and lasting impression . ? \\nit\\'s a tremendously funny and intelligent picture , but it also has an emotional center -- writer/director/star warren beatty allows the audience to identify with his character , and , in turn , we like him and actually care about the story . \\n ? \\nbeatty plays incumbent democratic senator jay billington bulworth ; the film opens and we see bulworth sobbing as he watches his television spots over and over again . ? \\nhe hasn\\'t slept in days , nor has he eaten , and , almost instantaneously , he goes insane . \\n ? he\\'s not stark raving mad ( not outright , anyway ) , but he\\'s definitely bonkers . \\n ? it\\'s the final weekend of his campaign , and his assistant , murphy ( oliver platt ) has written him a speech to feed to a group of black people in a church in the ghetto . \\n ? bulworth begins the speech , but suddenly goes off track and just starts being honest . ? \\n \" you mean , \" one lady asks , \" the democratic party doesn\\'t care about the african american community ? \" ? \\n \" well , \" he shouts , laughing , \" isn\\'t that obvious ? \" \\nthe story is propelled by a device in which bulworth puts out a contract on his own life ( he muses later that it\\'s a bad thing to make decisions when you\\'re suicidal ) ; he keeps seeing a man in sunglasses ( graham beckel ) whom he believes to be the hitman . \\n ? bulworth also meets nina ( halle berry ) with whom he becomes infatuated . \\n ? suddenly , in the short span of this weekend , bulworth\\'s no-nonsense \" truth in politics \" methods become a national sensation , and he shoots ahead in the polls despite the fact that he\\'s appearing on television wearing gang clothes and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences . \\nbeatty\\'s work on both sides of the camera is excellent . ? \\nhis script and direction are both extremely sharp , as is the surprisingly strong characterization of bulworth himself . ? \\nhere is a man who\\'s reached his limit , and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political structure . ? \\ni like that the film doesn\\'t take a clear shot at any of the political parties or affiliations , but at politics in general and how everything is run by the rich ( although the anti-rich sentiments do get a bit tiresome by the end of the film ) . ? \\nsome of the segments are simply hilarious , such as a lengthy rap that he delivers at a luncheon dedicated to him . ? \\nmuch of the film is completely absurd , but that\\'s the fun part about it . ? \\nit\\'s an angry , serious film at the core , but the package that beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in the genre . ? \\nwhat adds to this feeling is beatty\\'s portrayal of bulworth ; this is a performance that deserves recognition on a higher scale . \\n ? beatty is so much fun to watch here -- he\\'s always funny , but he\\'s also subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions . \\n ? beatty is so good that bulworth , despite his shortcomings as a human being , is an entirely sympathetic and likable character almost from the beginning . \\nthe supporting cast is vast and colorful . ? \\nberry is luminous , as always , and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles . ? \\ndon cheadle has a good role as a drug dealer who uses gun-toting toddlers to do his dirty work . ? \\noliver platt is an actor who should be careful , for someday i fear he may induce a heart attack with the intensity of his acting ( though he\\'s very funny to watch ) . ? paul sorvino adds the southern accent to his list of mastered inflections . \\nis bulworth offensive ? ? \\ni suppose some may see it that way . ? \\ni wasn\\'t offended by the film , but then again , i hardly care about politics . ? \\ni think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of the story . ? \\nthe film isn\\'t perfect , of course -- the ending didn\\'t quite work for me , and the a few of the scenes between bulworth and nina feel forced ( although the eclectic dance sequence is fantastic ) . ? \\nbut these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant film . ? \\nbulworth is a smart , uproariously funny picture that proves to me that political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface . ? \\n', b'call 911 for the cliche police if you must , but the eyes are the window to the soul . \\nthe finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze : paul newman , ralph fiennes , anthony hopkins , morgan freeman . \\nyou look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds , that the characters they play are real human beings . \\nwe will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor , but he had that unique quality in his eyes . \\nin gridlock\\'d , an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire , shakur and his co-star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry . \\nshakur and roth play ezekiel \" spoon \" whitmore and alexander \" stretch \" rome , two detroit buddies who share a spoken word/jazz trio , an apartment and a drug addiction with cookie ( thandie newton ) . \\nwhen a new year\\'s eve party ends with cookie comatose after a drug overdose , spoon and stretch begin to wonder if they are living on borrowed time . \\nthey soon make a new year\\'s resolution to get into rehab , but that proves to be easier said than done . \\nas though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough , spoon and stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting a road block of bureaucracy , confusion and red tape . \\nthe government might be the least of their obstacles , however , as they find themselves suspects in the murder of a drug dealer , and on the run from a nasty thug ( vondie curtis hall ) . \\nin order for you to buy into gridlock\\'d at all , you have to accept it as a surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism ; unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie , they are going to government offices on new year\\'s day , in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all . \\ngridlock\\'d may actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey , 1991\\'s falling down , which found a besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during a trek through inner city los angeles . \\nin falling down , michael douglas\\' d-fens ( the character\\'s personalized license plate , echoed in gridlock\\'d by the drug lord d-reper\\'s plates ) whips out a gun because he can\\'t get breakfast at mcdonald\\'s ; in gridlock\\'d , spoon and stretch are unarmed against the demands placed on them before they can get into a rehab center . \\nand where the unhinged d-fens became a heroic surrogate for audiences , writer/director vondie curtis hall refuses to let spoon and stretch off the hook for their own part in the situation . \\none bureaucrat responds to a tirade from stretch with the question , \" do you expect the world to stop . . . just \\nbecause you picked _today_ to clean up ? \" \\nthe world in gridlock\\'d is just as frustrating as the world in falling down , but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time . \\nhall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system , but perhaps not enough of them . \\na significant chunk of gridlock\\'d is devoted to spoon and stretch\\'s flight from d-reper and from the police , and those sub-plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments . \\nin one scene , stretch scares off d-reper by getting chummy with a police officer ; another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenly-suspected heroes in a public place watching a television news report of the crime which shows their pictures . \\nthe entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running , while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time . \\nhall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the film\\'s main events , perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through self-destructive behavior . \\noh , the irony of it . \\ntupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case , and living the life to back it up . \\nin gridlock\\'d , shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scares him . \\nspoon is an idea for a character at best as written by hall , but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction . \\nmostly it comes through those eyes , eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta . \\nit is spoon who plays conscience to stretch\\'s pure appetite , and roth plays stretch with a gleeful self-destructiveness ( he reveals that he is hiv positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again ) which is as much an obstacle to spoon\\'s goal as any agency or enemy . \\ngridlock\\'d\\'s most cruelly comic scene finds stretch \" helping \" spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with a tiny pocket knife , and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keeps has slowly drained the life out of him . \\nwith friends like that , spoon doesn\\'t need enemies , and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of a man who has seen too much . \\nthe tragedy now is that we won\\'t get more chances to see those eyes again . \\n', b'the happy bastard\\'s quick movie review \\ndamn that y2k bug . \\nit\\'s got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother ( william this time ) in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on . \\nlittle do they know the power within . . . \\ngoing for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there , virus still feels very empty , like a movie going for all flash and no substance . \\nwe don\\'t know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere , we don\\'t know the origin of what took over the ship ( just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir ) , and , of course , we don\\'t know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout . \\nhere , it\\'s just \" hey , let\\'s chase these people around with some robots \" . \\nthe acting is below average , even from the likes of curtis . \\nyou\\'re more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h20 . \\nsutherland is wasted and baldwin , well , he\\'s acting like a baldwin , of course . \\nthe real star here are stan winston\\'s robot design , some schnazzy cgi , and the occasional good gore shot , like picking into someone\\'s brain . \\nso , if robots and body parts really turn you on , here\\'s your movie . \\notherwise , it\\'s pretty much a sunken ship of a movie . \\n', b'after watching \" rat race \" last week , i noticed my cheeks were sore and realized that , when not laughing aloud , i had held a grin for virtually all of the film\\'s 112 minutes . \\nsaturday night , i attended another sneak preview for the movie and damned if i didn\\'t enjoy it as much the second time as the first . \\n \" rat race \" is a great goofy delight , a dandy mix of energetic performances , inspired sight gags and flat-out silliness . \\nhands down , this is the most fun film of the summer . \\nthe movie begins with zippy retro-style opening credits that look like they were torn straight out of a \\'60s slapstick comedy , featuring animated photos of the cast attached to herky-jerky bodies bounding around the screen . \\nthen comes the setup . \\ndonald sinclair ( john cleese ) , the extremely rich owner of the venetian hotel and casino in las vegas , enjoys concocting unusual bets for his high rolling clients . \\nto that end , he places a half dozen very special tokens in his slot machines . \\ngathering together the lucky token holders , he explains , \" today you have a chance to play a game where the odds of winning are one in six . \" \\nthe competition is simple : each contestant gets a key that opens a locker in silver city , n . m . , containing $2 million in cash . \\nthere is a transmitter in every key , so that sinclair and his cronies can keep track of who is ahead . \\nthe race has no rules ? whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets the money . \\nsince it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes , let\\'s use the next few paragraphs to profile the racers . \\ndecked out in flashy , trashy clothing and sporting big hair , vera baker ( whoopi goldberg ) is in town to reunite with the daughter she gave up for adoption as a baby . \\nshe finds that grown-up merrill ( lanai chapman ) is erudite , conservative and more than a little bit wary of this stranger trying to jump into her life . \\nthrown together , it becomes clear that both women share a fierce competitive nature . \\nowen templeton ( cuba gooding jr . ) is currently the most hated man in america . \\nan nfl referee , he cost gamblers all over the country enormous amounts of money by blowing a call in a high-profile game . \\nafter escaping from a vengeful cab driver , owen gets to new mexico by masquerading as the driver for a busload of lucy ricardo impersonators heading to a convention . \\nmr . pollini ( rowan atkinson ) is a cheerful , odd little italian man on holiday in america . \\nhe also is narcoleptic and falls asleep at the most inopportune times . \\npollini hitches a ride with zack ( wayne knight ) , a hyper-tense ambulance driver carrying a human heart across country for a transplant operation . \\nrandy pear ( jon lovitz ) promised his wife beverly ( kathy najimy ) and two kids a fun-filled vacation in las vegas . \\nfearful that beverly will be angry over his involvement in the race , he claims that he must travel to silver city for a job interview . \\nbeverly insists the family stay together , so they hop in the mini-van and tear off into the desert . \\nbrothers duane ( seth green ) and blaine ( vince vieluf ) cody are young , crooked and stupid . \\nblaine has a speech impediment due to his poorly self-done tongue piercing , and duane is the only person who can come close to understanding him . \\nthe boys will stop at nothing to reach their goal . \\nfinally , nick shaffer ( breckin meyer ) is a no-nonsense lawyer-in-training who recruits helicopter pilot tracy faucet ( amy smart ) for the journey . \\nat first glance , they seem blandly wholesome , but all that changes when tracy buzzes the home of her boyfriend shawn ( dean cain ) and spies him swimming with another woman . \\ndirector jerry zucker ( \" airplane , \" \" ghost \" ) leaps from racer to racer , periodically returning to las vegas where sinclair and mr . grisham ( dave thomas ) , his personality-impaired right hand man , continue cooking up bizarre bets for the gamblers . \\nas with any zucker production , a few jokes fall flat , but the momentum of the comedy zooms past those missteps . \\nhigh points for me include a bit involving kathy bates as a roadside squirrel salesperson and an intricately set up gag that carries jon lovitz and family from a bizarre museum to an outdoor rally , with an utterly tasteless and screamingly funny pay-off . \\nhad i been part of the filmmaking team , i would have ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a baby\\'s clothes and instead had the key get lost in the cleavage of a dozing society matron . \\nit would have drawn the same laugh without the squirm-inducing hint of child molestation . \\ni also would have selected a different band for a concert sequence . \\nmy god , do we really need yet another movie with smash mouth performing \" all star ? \" \\nbut enough carping . \\n \" rat race \" is a riot , with terrific no-holds-barred performances from the diverse cast . \\nsee it , see it again and when the dvd comes out , buy it , because a movie this hilarious will surely have outtakes to die for . \\n', b'a pseudo-intellectual film about the pseudo-intellectual world of art magazines , high art is as wasted as its drug-addled protagonists . \\nin the only notable part of the movie , ally sheedy and radha mitchell deliver nice performances in the two leading roles , not that lisa cholodenko\\'s script or direction makes you care much about either character . \\nliving in a world of heroin induced highs , they float along until they fall in love with each other . \\nthis uninviting picture , full of pretentious minor characters , has a receptionist that reads dostoevski and a woman in the restroom line who is a certified genius , having recently been awarded a prestigious mcarthur grant . \\n24-year-old syd ( radha mitchell ) , who has a rather bland , live-in boyfriend , was just promoted to assistant editor at the artistic photography magazine \" frame . \" \\nalthough the receptionist is impressed , syd is mainly a gofer for her boss until she meets famous photographer lucy berliner ( ally sheedy ) . \\nfor her to do photos for \" frame , \" lucy demands that syd be promoted to editor and assigned to her since lucy fancies her . \\nlucy lives with her current lover , a washed up german actress named greta , played with a frequently indecipherable series of mumbles by patricia clarkson . \\nthe two of them and their friends wile away their time snorting and shooting up dope , usually heroin . \\nthis does not happen in a single episode , but becomes more commonplace than sleeping in the picture . \\nsyd , who lives in the apartment below them , joins in on the fun and becomes a member of the zombie club . \\nlucy seems pretty happy with her life of drugs , which apparently is funded by her mother . \\nlucy quit working professionally 10 years ago since she thought she was being \" pigeonholed , \" and , since her mother has money , we can only assume that that\\'s how lucy supports her habit and procures her living expenses . \\na typical scene has the editors arguing about whether a potential photographer\\'s work is transcendental or merely classical . \\nthat no one has a clue as to the dogma they are spouting becomes obvious but not particularly funny . \\n \" your work has a cultural currency that is important now , \" is the artist-speak that the frame\\'s manager uses to convince lucy to show her pictures in the magazine . \\nwhen the big scene comes in which lucy puts the moves on syd , her idea of a romantic line is , \" i want to get high with you . \" \\nin lucy\\'s world , sex and drugs come hand-in-hand . \\nand the movie , except for the obligatory scene of someone almost overdosing , shows drug usage as being a hip and natural part of the art scene . \\nthis vacuous picture throws in a standard downer ending in an attempt to manipulate our emotions . \\nin another movie , it might have worked , but in this one the reaction is likely to be decidedly muted . \\nhigh art runs 1 : 36 . \\nit is rated r for explicit sex , pervasive drug use and language and is not appropriate for those younger than college age . \\n', b\"out of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in the limey , a cold , uninvolving , confusing new thriller . \\nthough the plot description may at first seem like it came from the pen of elmore leonard ( author of out of sight , as well as jackie brown , get shorty and pulp fiction ) , after you watch it , you realize that it's not nearly good enough . \\nin an aggressively non-linear fashion , the limey ( li * mey , noun : an english gentleman ) tells the story of wilson ( terrence stamp ) , a british ex-con just released from a 9 year stint in prison for armed robbery . \\nhe has come to the us to seek vengeance for the death of his daughter jenny . \\nhe doesn't know much about the circumstances of her demise , all he has is a name : terry valentine . \\nvalentine was jenny's former boyfriend , a wealthy and corrupt record executive . \\nhe's played by peter fonda , in his first major role since the terrific ulee's gold in 1997 . \\nseeking valentine's reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy task for wilson . \\nhe finally finds the impressive abode high in the mountains and sneaks in just as valentine is having a big party . \\nhe winds up breaking his cover eventually , setting off valentine's head of security and valentine himself , who decides to run for it . \\nwhat a mess . \\ni have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by the linearity of time -- pulp fiction , which twisted time every which way , was a masterpiece -- but i do take exception to movies that decide to play around with it for no reason other than to confuse the viewer . \\nthe limey does exactly that . \\nthe plot is permeated with flashbacks , flash-forwards and what can only be described as random time-travel , without any evident purpose . \\nthere is no method to this movie's madness . \\nit uses a fancy way to tell a story that would be better off told more conventionally and more comprehendably . \\nthe plot isn't particularly interesting in the first place : traditional , mildly hackneyed and not very involving . \\nthis is a sort of brooding film -- our protagonist doesn't speak much and the action sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude . \\ni felt like the director wasn't very interested in the proceedings himself , almost like he made this film for a paycheck . \\nditto for the editing , which seems to be deliberately sloppy and unpleasant . \\nsixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging criminal . \\nhe's not much in the way of stature but he has a surprisingly imposing physical presence that works to his advantage here . \\npeter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor : he's shy , quiet but always effective . \\nhe's adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression : his feelings don't always show on his face by you can always tell what they are . \\nthis is basically a conventional thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre fashion . \\nwhy soderbergh couldn't just parrot down and tell a story , i don't know , but what he does do certainly doesn't work . \\nthe result is a wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil -- even the action scenes don't work . \\n1999 may have signified the death of the traditional act one - act two - act three storyline , but obviously some movies have not yet transcended it . \\nshall we go back to basics ? \\n\", b'synopsis : a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boy\\'s mother , a fledgling restauranteur . \\nunsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman\\'s favor , he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way . \\ncomments : stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned-psychos-getting-their-revenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry , both theatrical and direct-to-video . \\ntheir proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they\\'re typically inexpensive to produce ( no special effects , no big name stars ) and serve as vehicles to flash nudity ( allowing them to frequent late-night cable television ) . \\nstalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect : the psycho never actually has an affair ; on the contrary , he\\'s rejected rather quickly ( the psycho typically is an ex-lover , ex-wife , or ex-husband ) . \\nother than that , stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable . \\nstalked does not provide much suspense , though that is what it sets out to do . \\ninterspersed throughout the opening credits , for instance , a serious-sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk ( it\\'s implicitly implied that all stalkers are men ) while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen . \\nafter these credits , a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears . \\nthe narrator states that \" this is the story of daryl gleason \" and tells the audience that he is the stalker . \\nof course , really , this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels . \\nif the movie was meant to be about daryl , then it should have been called stalker not stalked . \\nokay . so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts ; no guesswork required . \\nstalked proceeds , then , as it begins : obvious , obvious , obvious . \\nthe opening sequence , contrived quite a bit , brings daryl and brooke ( the victim ) together . \\ndaryl obsesses over brooke , follows her around , and tries to woo her . \\nultimately rejected by her , his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate . \\nthese plans include the all-time , psycho-in-love , cliche : the murdered pet . \\nfor some reason , this genre\\'s films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked . \\nstalked is no exception ( it\\'s a cat this time -- found in the shower ) . \\nevents like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked , where only one survives ( guess who it invariably always is and you\\'ll guess the conclusion to this turkey ) . \\nstalked\\'s cast is uniformly adequate : not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either . \\njay underwood , as the stalker , turns toward melodrama a bit too much . \\nhe overdoes it , in other words , but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands . \\nmaryam d\\'abo , about the only actor close to being a star here ( she played the bond chick in the living daylights ) , is equally adequate as the \" stalked \" of the title , even though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong , independent business-owner . \\nbrooke ( d\\'abo ) needs to be ditzy , however , for the plot to proceed . \\ntoward the end , for example , brooke has her suspicions about daryl . \\nto ensure he won\\'t use it as another excuse to see her , brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his house . \\ndoes she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers ? \\nof course not . \\nshe tries the door , opens it , and wanders around the house . \\nwhen daryl returns , he enters the house , of course , so our heroine is in danger . \\nsomehow , even though her car is parked at the front of the house , right by the front door , daryl is oblivious to her presence inside . \\nthe whole episode places an incredible strain on the audience\\'s suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either character\\'s intelligence . \\nstalked receives two stars because , even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring , it is not so bad that it cannot be watched . \\nrated r mostly for several murder scenes and brief nudity in a strip bar , it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are . \\nif you\\'re in the mood for a good suspense film , though , stake out something else . \\n', b'john carpenter makes b-movies . \\nalways has ( \" halloween , \" \" escape from new york , \" \" the thing \" ) and , by the looks of it ( \" they live , \" \" escape from l . a . , \" \" vampires \" ) , always will . \\ncarpenter\\'s latest horror opus with a science fiction bent ( or science fiction outing with a schlock horror bent ) is the aptly-titled \" john carpenter\\'s ghosts of mars \" ( in case , i suppose , you went looking for someone else\\'s \" ghosts of mars \" ) . \\nlike all those films prefixed by the very possessive \" john carpenter\\'s , \" \" ghosts of mars \" is an unashamed b-movie punctuated by a b-movie plot , b-movie actors , and b-movie special effects . \\nin category one , above , we have a storyline that borders on idiotic ( and , at times , chaotic ) . \\ndormant martians ( i . e . , swirling red gases ) awakened by meddling humans possess the souls of hapless mining colonists rendering them testy marilyn manson lookalikes . \\nall this explained ( in flashback ) to some grand pooh-bah counsel by martian police official melanie ballard ( natasha henstridge , from the sub- \" species \" films ) , the only returnee on a silly-looking train . \\nofficer ballard went in to bring back incarcerated felon james \" desolation \" williams ; what she found was not a pretty picture . \\nin the second category we have ms . henstridge , her blonde hair pulled back tightly and awkwardly into a ponytail , ice cube ( as the appropriately-named \" desolation \" ) , pam grier ( briefly , oddly--who wanted to work with whom i wonder ? ) , and a host of extras all assuming that the story and special effects were going to carry this film and therefore they didn\\'t need to try too hard . \\nin category number three we have , in addition to those swirling red gases and the silly-looking train , a couple of bird\\'s-eye-view shots of a sprawling martian metropolis ( reddish also ) . \\nstate-of-the-art special effects have never been a carpenter trademark and once again the writer/director ( who seems to have no problem finding work , however ) doesn\\'t waste any of the film\\'s budget in that department . \\n \" ghosts of mars \" is lock , laughing stock , and barrel all your standard carpenter fare : dingy interiors , cluttered exteriors , inane dialogue , lots of leather , scarred , crazed-looking aliens , and lots and lots of weaponry . \\nthe film often and always explodes into warfare without warning--spontaneously , stupidly . \\ncarpenter might like to think he\\'s made a western here but it\\'s a western without any real heroes , villains , or border conflicts . \\nit\\'s just the shootouts minus a hissing snake plissken . \\ni never thought i\\'d miss the guy but i do . \\nit\\'s not * all * the same , however . \\ndubbed the \" one-note wonder \" for his minimalist music soundtracks , carpenter seems to have graduated from simplistic ( yet effective ) scoring by highlighting his action with loud , screeching guitar work . \\nfortunately this drowns out a lot of the dialogue . \\nthe final exchange between henstridge and , er , cube though is both audible * and * priceless . \\nmars has proven an infertile breeding ground for hollywood in the last year or so , what with the stillborn \" mission to mars \" and \" red planet \" ( with val kilmer ) . \\n \" ghosts of mars \" sadly adds to those disappointing returns ( in its opening weekend it was overshadowed by a bunch of sequels , among them \" american pie 2 \" and \" rush hour 2 \" ) . \\nthe irony is that the mars in carpenter\\'s film feels sadly absent . \\nthere are occasional references to the red planet , of course , but the film might as well have been set in perth amboys than on earth\\'s closest neighbor . \\ntwo things keep \" john carpenter\\'s ghosts of mars \" from getting a huge slap upside the head . \\n1 . \\nhenstridge keeps her top on ( miraculously ) , and 2 . the film doesn\\'t pretend to be anything it\\'s not . \\nwhat that means , however , is that fans of superior , intelligent , grade a sci-fi/horror are singularly out of luck . \\n', b'so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful sci-fi films such as close encounters of the third kind , 2001 : a space odyssey , apollo 13 and contact ? \\nwell , whatever it is , you\\'d sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange , considering the disastrous results we\\'re left with here . \\nthis is a film that takes a little bit of everything , but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing ! \\nit\\'s like i said . . . this \\nmovie sucks . \\nplot : a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020 , after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet . \\ncritique : extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie . \\nuneven , would be another . \\nthe trailer for this movie actually showed some promise , the buzz around it had been so-so , and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes , all leading you to believe that it\\'s actually going to go \" somewhere \" . \\nbut it isn\\'t long before the entire movie downshifts into neutral , features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherry-colored planet , tries too hard to get us into the \" pain \" of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix . \\nin a sci-fi movie ? \\nwell , i don\\'t know , much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and a half , only to figure out some big secret in the end , a secret which practically had me yawning with excitement . \\nultimately , this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise , joins the crew in their \" misadventures in space \" for the main crux of its journey , and eventually settles down for one of the most anti-climactic endings this side of contact . \\nmind you , if you enjoyed that film\\'s shrug-of-the-shoulders ending , you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well . \\nof course , i don\\'t remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story . \\nugh . \\nwhat a friggin\\' mess . \\nfilms like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again . \\ndidn\\'t anybody recognize the crappiness in this script ? \\ndidn\\'t they read the bad dialogue , the cheezy lines , the obvious derivative nature of the work ( mind you , with a director like depalma at the helm , that ain\\'t saying much ! ) . \\nof course , you can\\'t really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry o\\'connell in this fine crew of thespians . \\n\\'nuff said . \\nneither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the film\\'s musical score during the last fifteen minutes , presumably in order to wake the audience up ( okay , we get it brian , this scene is supposed to be powerful . . . wow . . . yawn . . . my \\nears hurt ! ) . \\nso is anything salvageable in this movie ? \\nsure . \\ngary sinise does another great job , as does cheadle , the film doesn\\'t completely bore you as much as it just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening , and yes , the \" sand-twister \" effect that you see in the commercial is well done . \\nother than that ? \\ni guess i could say that i admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies . . . oops , \\ndid i say \" admire \" , i meant \" am disgusted \" ! \\nall in all , this movie delivers very little in actual substance , offers two-bit dialogue masked in a lot of sci-fi mumbo-jumbo , pretends to be deep when really it\\'s just sappy , and eventually just settles into an ending which , other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story , gives us little more to think about than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck . \\ngo see the ninth gate . . . now \\nthere\\'s a great movie ! \\nand on a personal note , i think it\\'s time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12-minute uninterrupted film sequences , and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting . \\n', b\"lengthy and lousy are two words to describe the boring drama the english patient . \\ngreat acting , music and cinematography were nice , but too many dull sub-plots and characters made the film hard to follow . \\nralph fiennes ( strange days , schindler's list ) gives a gripping performance as count laszlo almasy , a victim of amnesia and horrible burns after world war ii in italy . \\nthe story revolves around his past , in flashback form , making it even more confusing . \\nanyway , he is taken in by hana ( juliette binoche , the horseman on the roof ) , a boring war-torn nurse . \\nshe was never really made into anything , until she met an indian towards the end , developing yet another sub-plot . \\ncount almasy begins to remember what happened to him as it is explained by a stranger ( willem dafoe , basquiat ) . \\nhis love ( kirstin scott thomas , mission impossible ) was severely injured in a plane crash , and eventually died in a cave . \\nhe returned to find her dead and was heart-broken . \\nso he flew her dead body somewhere , but was shot down from the ground . \\ndon't get the wrong idea , it may sound good and the trailer may be tempting , but good is the last thing this film is . \\nmaybe if it were an hour less , it may have been tolerable , but 2 hours and 40 minutes of talking is too much to handle . \\nthe only redeeming qualities about this film are the fine acting of fiennes and dafoe and the beautiful desert cinematography . \\nother than these , the english patient is full of worthless scenes of boredom and wastes entirely too much film . \\n , \\n\", b'capsule : where are you tonight , leni rienfenstal ? \\nstarship troopers is an expensive , hateful and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography -- and bad pornography , at that . \\nit is not good cinema , not good storytelling , and not even stupid fun : it\\'s so cynically , calculatedly bone-headed that even the least demanding members of the audience i was with were alternately bored and revulsed . \\nit\\'s one of the worst movies i\\'ve seen in a long time . \\nwhy am i calling this movie pornography ? \\npornography , in the abstract , is anything which is calculated to appeal to the baser instincts . \\ni remember reading a review of full metal jacket which described the climact moment at the end of the movie , where private joker has to shoot the downed vc sniper , as \" a near-pornographic eternity \" . \\ni didn\\'t agree with that assessment , but i could see what was being implied : the reviewer felt as if the audience was being incited to stand up and pump their fists and shout \" do \\'er , man , do \\'er ! \" \\nthat sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers . \\nit\\'s * literally * like a giant recruitment film that has gone berserk . \\nit tries frantically to enlist our emotions but it winds up only being dull or sickening . \\nthe film takes place in our future , when earth has come under attack by some alien species that doesn\\'t appear to have intelligence . \\nto counterattack , humankind does the single stupidest thing imaginable : instead of nuke the planet from orbit , which they\\'re clearly capable of , they send down grunts with m-16 rifles . \\nthis isn\\'t heinlein , it\\'s a bad wwii movie , one where all the most obvious points of satire are ever poked and prodded in combat scenes that are noisy , repetitive , and ultimately tiresome . \\n ( one scene has a journalist on a battlefield , filimg soldiers being slaughtered , and ends with groaning predictability : said cameraman gets skewered , too . ) \\nthe soldiers and their commanders are consistently idiotic . \\nthey do not possess a germ of tactical intelligence or even common sense . \\nthey don\\'t even behave like soldiers in a bad * movie * , and therefore we don\\'t care about them . \\nwe hated the tom berenger character in platoon , but he * mattered * , and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate . \\nhere , we don\\'t even hate the bugs -- what\\'s there to hate ? \\nhating them would be like cursing a hurricaine . \\nif there\\'s anything really hateful there , the movie doesn\\'t know how to give it to us . \\nthe screenwriter ( ed neumeier -- perhaps a better appelation would be \" screen typist \" ) and director ( the increasingly talent-impaired paul verhoeven ) have not found any way to make the characters or the story serve each other . \\none of the subplots concerns a woman pilot who\\'s great at getting out of tight situations , and does it again and again and again . \\nonce or twice is fine . \\nby the fifth or sixth time , it\\'s worn out its welcome . \\nthere\\'s never any sense that these people are really thinking their way out of anything , or really being tested to show their mettle . \\nalso , the movie is irritatingly selective with how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponry . \\nif a bug has one of the humans screaming in its grasp , then five guys can stand around it and blast away on full auto without doing a damned thing . \\nbut if one human gets cornered , he lays waste to whole platoons of bugs with one clip . \\nuh-huh . \\nthe very worst feature of the movie is its repulsive quasi-fascist flavor . \\ni say \" quasi- \" because while the movie uses many of the trappings of fascism ot eroticize its action -- the gear , the uniforms , etc . -- the movie doesn\\'t have the nerve ( or the brains ) to be genuinely fascist , or intelligent about the subject . \\nthe bumpers between scenes , which are apparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propaganda are propaganda -- just so clumsy and oafish that they wind up making the bugs look relatively innocuous in comparison . \\nlike the rest of the movie . \\nthere\\'s more , i suppose , but it\\'s not worth it . \\nthe acting is bland , neither arsenic nor gravy ; the music disposable ; the camerawork turgid . \\nthe heartbreaking thing is that it makes independence day look like a masterpiece . \\n', b'capsule : in 2176 on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace . \\nthere is a lot of fighting and not a whole lot of story otherwise . \\njohn carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films , especially assault on precinct 13 , that the new film comes off as his homage to himself . \\n , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) . \\njohn carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes . \\nfor a writer and director of horror films , supposedly an expert on horror , it is a very bad mistake to make . \\nghosts of mars is called a horror movie , but it is more just a drawn out fight between humans and a surprisingly low-powered alien menace . \\nin addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars , carpenter would have grounds to sue . \\nthis film is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct 13 , the thing , and prince of darkness . \\nit is , in fact , surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way . \\nbut that still does not make for a really good science fiction experience . \\nghosts of mars takes place in the year 2176 . \\nmars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear ( which is good for the film\\'s budget ) . \\nit is never mentioned , but the gravity on mars has been increased somehow to earth-normal , again making it easier to film . \\nsociety has changed a bit by that time , but it has advanced surprisingly little . \\napparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control . \\nand from carpenter\\'s view , women have really made a mess of things . \\nsociety has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in ten . \\nthe basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct 13 except that precinct 9 ( yes , precinct 9 ) has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony . \\ninstead of having the criminal \" napolean \" wilson , this film has the criminal \" desolation \" williams . \\ninstead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face , well , ghosts of mars . \\nbecause the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner , but they essentially behave as human savages , in another lapse of imagination . \\nthe story is told in flashback , flashback within flashback , and flashback within flashback within flashback . \\nghosts of mars takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red , yellow , and black . \\ncarpenter manages to give us a powerful opening scene , showing a mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with a heavy beat . \\nsadly what follows is not really up to the buildup . \\nthe terror he creates looks a little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss . \\nhis idea of building suspense is having a bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring . \\nthese are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience . \\nsomewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights . \\nwithin a short stretch of time we have seen the release of mission to mars , red planet , and ghosts of mars . \\nafter mission to mars was panned by too many reviewers it looks better and better and better as time goes by . \\ni rate ghosts of mars a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\nfollowing the movie i showed my wife , who liked ghosts of mars moderately more than i did , carpenter\\'s classic assault on precinct 13 . \\nher comment is that it was seeing the same film twice . \\n', b'will hunting ( matt damon ) is a natural genius . \\nfor a movie character , that\\'s usually a death sentence . \\nit\\'s a trait associated with what my brother calls \" too good for this world \" movies , like phenomenon or powder . \\nforgive me for spoiling the ending , but will doesn\\'t die . \\nthis is no formula movie . \\nin fact , it\\'s quite fresh and original . \\nit\\'s a character study more than anything , and that\\'s not surprising , considering it was written by two actors : damon and co-star ben affleck . \\nwill works whatever kind of job he can get . \\nfirst he\\'s a janitor , then he works construction . \\noff-screen he speed reads books on any academic subject that interests him . \\non-screen he hangs out with his friends , picking fights in robust , romanticized-hemingway fashion . \\nlambeau ( stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves ) , a math professor , learns that the janitor ( will ) is a genius with a special talent for advanced mathematics . \\nhaving confirmed he\\'s not a fluke or a savant , he does what he can to get will into the education system . \\nhe is firmly rejected . \\nfinally , will lands in jail for one of his fights . \\nlambeau can get him probation instead of prison time as long as will agrees to therapy sessions and to discussing mathematics with him . \\nwill ( barely ) decides to go for the therapy over prison . \\nlambeau treats will like a son . \\nhe\\'s proud of , and amazed by , will\\'s accomplishments in mathematics . \\nhe encourages will and tries to give him structure , knowing that , with a little discipline , he could be bigger than einstein . \\nwill isn\\'t really interested in academia . \\nhe knows he would be the best in his field , and therefore spend all of his time in an office , explaining math to people like lambeau . \\nhe would rather work construction , which breaks lambeau\\'s heart . \\nmeanwhile , will attends his mandated therapy sessions . \\nit\\'s not long before he shreds all the therapists on lambeau\\'s \" a \" list . \\nwill has read enough psychology to know the tricks of the trade , and how to keep them from affecting him . \\nshrink after shrink refuses to return after will\\'s mockery . \\nlambeau\\'s last hope is his old college roommate , now a psychology teacher at a small-time community college . \\nknowing that will is going to try to shred him too , sean ( robin williams ) agrees to take him on as a favor to lambeau and for the chance to meet this next einstein . \\ntrue to form , will finds sean\\'s emotional weakness and attacks . \\nbut unlike the other shrinks , sean knows what he is in for and continues the sessions . \\nlike a foster mother with a fussy child , sean knows that the attacks are defensive and is able to take them in stride . \\nlike the foster mother , sean knows that time and quiet patience is the only approach . \\nrobin williams is excellent in this role . \\nhe\\'s not an actor with a great range , but in the right roles he has great depth . \\nin this movie , as in awakenings , there comes a point when the quiet , shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance , and a smile of pure joy spreads up to his eyes . \\nwilliams is the only actor i can name who can make an audience cry just by smiling . \\ni have compared will to a foster child and that\\'s not entirely fair . \\nemotionally , he has a lot to learn , but he is not a child . \\nhe has thought about his life and made rational decisions about what he wants . \\nsean , his girlfriend , his pals , and lambeau all help him grow , but he didn\\'t start out asking for , or particularly needing , help . \\nhis exceptional gift singled him out , and those who love him kept pushing him in the right direction . \\nif i had to say anything bad about good will hunting is that it walks the line between drama and melodrama . \\nit\\'s too sentimental and uplifiting for a straight drama , but the emotions are too subtle for melodrama . \\nit is emotionally engaging , but it\\'s not quite larger than life . \\nthis isn\\'t a problem per se , but at times i didn\\'t know quite how to take it . \\nbut this is a relatively small complaint about a very good movie . \\na good movie allows its characters to learn and grow . \\nit doesn\\'t just happen ; it takes a good script , good acting , and good direction . \\ngood will hunting has all three . \\nif you are at all inclined to see it , by all means , go . \\n', b'after bloody clashes and independence won , lumumba refused to pander to the belgians , who continued a condescending and paternalistic relationship with the congo . \\ntheir officers , particularly general janssens ( rudi delhem ) in the force publique , the congo\\'s army , caused rebellions , undermining lumumba , who was outraged at the rape and murder of belgian nationals . \\nwith unrest building , moise tshombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and the province of katanga , which contained 70 percent of the country\\'s resources , proclaimed secession . \\nlumumba replaced janssens , making mobutu a colonel , and went on a pacification \\ntour with congolese president joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) , but it was too late . \\n\\'when you want to drown a dog , you say it has rabies , \\' prophesies lumumba of his own fate . \\npeck and bonitzer do an exemplary job telling a complicated tale with a myriad of players , although they frequently succumb to cliche , particularly regarding lumumba\\'s private life . \\npeck\\'s script illuminates bantu sayings like \\'the hand that gives , rules\\' when lumumba uses it with the american ambassador . \\npeck\\'s direction is less assured , with many scenes unfortunately playing like standard television fare . \\nhe\\'s served well , though , by his casting of ebouaney in the title role . \\nebouaney is dynamic , radiating his character\\'s fierce passion for his people and his country . \\nlumumba\\'s intelligence and ability to strategize , even as he\\'s cornered by insurmountable odds , are given life by ebouaney . \\npeck\\'s subject and lead actor elevate his film above its mediocre production . \\n \" lumumba \" is a story that deserves to be told and ebouaney\\'s performance makes the tragedy personally felt . \\n', b'plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . \\nthey get into an accident . \\none of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . \\nwhat\\'s the deal ? \\nwatch the movie and \" sorta \" find out . . . \\ncritique : a mind-fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . \\nwhich is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just didn\\'t snag this one correctly . \\nthey seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . \\nso what are the problems with the movie ? \\nwell , its main problem is that it\\'s simply too jumbled . \\nit starts off \" normal \" but then downshifts into this \" fantasy \" world in which you , as an audience member , have no idea what\\'s going on . \\nthere are dreams , there are characters coming back from the dead , there are others who look like the dead , there are strange apparitions , there are disappearances , there are a looooot of chase scenes , there are tons of weird things that happen , and most of it is simply not explained . \\nnow i personally don\\'t mind trying to unravel a film every now and then , but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again , i get kind of fed up after a while , which is this film\\'s biggest problem . \\nit\\'s obviously got this big secret to hide , but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes . \\nand do they make things entertaining , thrilling or even engaging , in the meantime ? \\nnot really . \\nthe sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half-way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still didn\\'t the make the film all that more entertaining . \\ni guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is \" into it \" even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding . \\ni mean , showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! ! \\nokay , we get it . . . there \\nare people chasing her and we don\\'t know who they are . \\ndo we really need to see it over and over again ? \\nhow about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie ? \\napparently , the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves , and it shows . \\nthere might\\'ve been a pretty decent teen mind-fuck movie in here somewhere , but i guess \" the suits \" decided that turning it into a music video with little edge , would make more sense . \\nthe actors are pretty good for the most part , although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty , only in a new neighborhood . \\nbut my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller , who holds her own throughout the entire film , and actually has you feeling her character\\'s unraveling . \\noverall , the film doesn\\'t stick because it doesn\\'t entertain , it\\'s confusing , it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime , despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it . \\noh , and by the way , this is not a horror or teen slasher flick . . . it\\'s \\njust packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids . \\nit also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since . \\nwhatever . . . skip \\nit ! \\nwhere\\'s joblo coming from ? \\na nightmare of elm street 3 ( 7/10 ) - blair witch 2 ( 7/10 ) - the crow ( 9/10 ) - the crow :

teens having sex , doing drugs , having sex , listening to eminem , having sex , playing video games , having sex , and killing one of their peers , then \" bully \" \\'s for you . \\nbased on jim schutze\\'s novelization of a true-life event , \" bully \" charts the story of a handful of disenchanted teenagers who , in 1993 , murdered their high school bully in cold , calculated blood . \\nthe film could have provided fascinating insights into what turned these aimless kids into premeditated killers . \\nin the hands of controversial director larry clark ( \" kids \" ) , however , it has less to say about its subject matter and more to say about the filmmaker\\'s pornographic proclivities . \\nin terms of the incident and what provoked it , \" bully \" stirs up nothing new . \\nthe high schoolers are presented as a uniformly screwed up lot--bored with life , not much ambition , promiscuous , profane . \\nthe bully in question , bobby kent ( nick stahl ) , is certainly an unpleasant piece of work but he doesn\\'t exactly tower over his colleagues in the pathological department . \\nhe hounds and harries and humiliates his \" best friend \" marty ( played by brad renfro ) and marty\\'s girlfriend lisa ( rachel miner ) doesn\\'t care for it at all and comes up with the idea of killing bobby . \\nsimply remove him from the equation . \\nmarty and lisa and a handful of their promiscuous , profane , and stoner friends , plus a recruited hit man ( ? ) , lure bobby to a swamp one night , stab him , beat him over the head with a baseball bat , and dump him into the canal where the sand crabs and the gators , presumably , finish him off . \\nthere\\'s no remorse--the next day they\\'re talking about it as openly as a homework assignment . \\nthey did it because they wanted to , and because they could . \\nwhat\\'s most troubling about the film , however , isn\\'t the unsettling subject matter and the matter-of-fact way these young people go about eliminating one of their own but the way in which clark is constantly distracted by his own material . \\nnot only is the nudity plentiful and graphic in \" bully \" but there\\'s also an uneasy , exploitative feel to it . \\ngratuitous crotch shots abound ( one of which makes the zipper cut-away in \" there\\'s something about mary \" look like the height of subtlety ! ) . \\nclark is so pre-occupied with his female ( predominantly ) leads that you forget , at times , what this movie is supposed to be about . \\nthe stripping bare , literally and figuratively , of these actors ( who are , after all , playing underage teenagers ) becomes harder to watch over time , as you begin to feel for them and question the motives of the man behind the camera . \\nthe conclusion of \" bully \" offers up literal snapshots of information about the sentences imposed on each of the protagonists for their involvement in the crime . \\nit\\'s a short sequence of stills--heather : 7 years ; ali : 40 years ; lisa : life imprisonment , for example--but it\\'s infinitely more telling than the 110 minutes of rampant unpleasantness that precedes it . \\n \" bully \" aims for truth , exploits it shamelessly , then bludgeons it to death . \\n', b'a follow-up to disney\\'s live-action \" 101 dalmatians \" that\\'s better , more entertaining than the first ? \\njust as unlikely . \\nwith \" 102 dalmatians , \" the disney studios have proven that when it comes to going to the dogs , more is definitely * not * the merrier . \\n1996\\'s \" 101 dalmatians \" certainly wasn\\'t the greatest movie-going experience of all time , but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous , larger-than-life performance . \\nin addition , we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson , and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies . \\nthis time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen , and close\\'s facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the 53-year-old actress under that startling black and white wig of hers . \\nbut that\\'s only half the problem with kevin lima\\'s laborious film . \\nwhat makes \" 102 dalmatians \" such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor ( here almost single-handedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks he\\'s a dog , voiced by eric idle ) , its rabid plotlessness ( cruella goes after puppies again ; winds up in goo again ) and most of all , the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic \" heroes \" of the piece , a welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blander-than-bland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo ? . \\ngruffudd is cute and harmless , perhaps , but evans can\\'t even aspire to that . \\nthe dogs upstage them both , of course , but in the case of evans , even close\\'s split ends are more animated . \\nbad acting , however , seems to be a requirement for this sequel , since g ? rard depardieu shows up as a french furrier with a haircut like robert de niro\\'s in \" men of honor . \" \\njean pierre le pelt is a flamboyant fashion designer with a penchant for fine furs and depardieu\\'s over-the-top antics mimic those of the campy close flail for flail , and wail for wail . \\nfrance\\'s most popular export besides brie has long since turned into a caricature of himself , and in \" 102 dalmatians \" the producers milk that realization for all it\\'s worth--le pelt likes to refer to the furry little critters as \" poopies , \" par example ( and ad nauseum ) . \\nthe finesses of the script ( attributed to four screenwriters no less , and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up ) are quickly dispensed with , since all it takes for a paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben ( ? ) . \\nthat done , it\\'s back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore off-limits sables and minks and a plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of a hooded designer gown . \\nthe dogs are pretty cute--try making a puppy look otherwise--but that\\'s pretty much all they are . \\nthere\\'s always the feeling that there\\'s a trainer off in the wings , coaxing the dogs to open doors , or pick up their food bowls in unison , or pop a tape into the videocasette recorder . \\nsavvy holiday goers should skip \" 102 dalmatians \" and pop the original 1961 animated classic into * their * vcrs instead . \\nit\\'s one dalmatian less , but 101% more satisfying . \\n', b'my giant is two movies for the price of one , but neither is worth the cost of admission , even if you get in free . \\nas lamely directed by michael lehmann , the picture tries to be a comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book . \\n ( \" without goliath , david is just some punk throwing rocks . \" ) \\nlanguidly paced throughout , the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer ( the omen ) meanders toward its sad ending . \\nsince it\\'s rarely funny or convincingly dramatic , what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains a mystery . \\nother than a few nice visuals , there\\'s nothing to recommend the picture . \\nwith great film comedies under his belt from when harry met sally ? to the original city slickers , billy crystal has shown that he\\'s more than the world\\'s best oscar host . \\nhe does , however , have a propensity for choosing hopeless material as in last year\\'s father\\'s day and this year\\'s my giant . \\none wonders if he reads the script before agreeing to go ahead with a project . \\nsurely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there was nothing there . \\nperhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success . \\nor maybe he wants to be a dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious with the movie\\'s somber tone . \\nthe most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget they saw it by the next day . \\nthis one-joke movie\\'s single idea is to place real-life basketball player gheorghe muresan , who stands seven and a half feet tall , into as many visually striking situations as possible . \\nsammy ( crystal ) , an agent currently without clients , is rescued after a car accident by a sweet romanian giant named max ( muresan ) . \\nafter throwing out constant one-liners ( \" either god is in the salvage business or big foot just took my car . \" ) , \\nsammy decides to get serious , seeing max as his meal ticket . \\nand although he doesn\\'t like it , he\\'s willing to sign max up to do disgusting events like a wrestling match with a half-dozen dwarfs . \\n ( the movie itself knows no bounds as it contains one of the most putrid and lengthy vomiting scenes ever . ) \\nafter a series of missed opportunities , the comedic part of the movie is over , and it turns into a cheap and maudlin disease movie . \\nwe learn that max\\'s condition is terminal , and he will soon die . \\nto be fair , the movie does contain a few good scenes - all of which you can see in the trailers . \\nlet\\'s hope billy gets himself a pair of reading glasses before he signs up for another movie . \\nmy giant runs too long even at just 1 : 37 . \\nit is rated pg for violence and profanity and would be acceptable for kids around ten and up . \\nmy son jeffrey and his friend matthew , both 9 , gave the movie a single star and had nothing good to say about it . \\nmatthew pointed out that it \" is not as good as it could have been or should have been . \" \\n ( amen . ) \\nhe went on to comment that he did not like the way the movie changed completely in the middle . \\njeffrey complained particularly about how gross the movie was . \\n', b'janeane garofalo in a romantic comedy -- it was a good idea a couple years ago with the truth about cats and dogs but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker . \\nthis is a by-the-books movie that plods along on a predestined course with no surprises and very few laughs . \\nit also jumps on the ever-popular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there , too . \\ngarofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator ( jay o . sanders ) running for reelection . \\ndenis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal- plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent that\\'s made the kennedy family so popular . \\nso leary orders garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relatives to exploit . \\nshe soon learns why \" easier said than done \" is the mantra of movies like this . \\nthe matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that can go wrong -- garofalo has to take a tiny plane to ireland , almost misses the bus to town , can\\'t get a hotel room , ends up in the smallest , trashiest one around , has a dog piss on her luggage , and so on . \\nthen comes what roger ebert calls the \" meet cute . \" \\nit happens in every romance : the man and woman have to meet each other for the first time in some unconventional , cinematic way . \\nin the matchmaker , it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom and finds a nude sean ( david o\\'hara ) in the bathtub , his dog sitting at his side . \\nno points for guessing it\\'s the same dog that just made water on her luggage . \\nalso no points for guessing garofalo hates o\\'hara on sight . \\nthat\\'s how it works in movies like these . \\ni know from the instant i saw that irishman in the bathtub that she\\'d hate him for awhile , then succumb to his charms , live happily for a reel or so before allowing some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil , after which they\\'d reconcile in time for a happy irish tune to play over the end credits . \\ni haven\\'t mentioned the movie\\'s twist yet . \\ngarofalo comes to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival , during which lonely folks from around the county pair off into a future of bliss . \\nmilo o\\'shea ( who looks like an irish tom snyder ) is the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together . \\nrest assured he\\'ll do all he can to match up garofalo and o\\'hara . \\noh , and in keeping with the matchmaker\\'s utter predictability , he dies toward the end . \\nwhat the message here ? \\nsometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction , like garofalo , will sell out with a weak script . \\ni was excited to see garofalo and leary in the same movie , but they actually only have two or three scenes together . \\nleary stays stateside , for the most part , yelling at garofalo over the phone and generally being an asshole . \\nhe even undoes himself with the old microphone\\'s still on after he\\'s done giving the speech cliche . \\nboth of them should have known better . \\n', b'sean connery stars as a harvard law professor who heads back into the courtroom , by way of the everglades , to defend a young , educated black man ( blair underwood ) . \\nthe guy is on death row for the murder of a white girl , and says that his confession was coerced from the region\\'s tough , black cop ( lawrence fishburne ) . \\nwatching connery and fishburne bump heads for two hours is amusing enough , but the plot\\'s a joke . \\nthere\\'s no logic at work here . \\ntone is also an issue--there is none . \\ndirector arne glimcher never establishes exactly what his film is trying to say . \\nis it a statement on human rights ? \\nis it a knock-off of silence of the lambs ? \\nglimcher never tells . \\ninstead , he forces his characters to jump through hoop after hoop , over drawbridge after drawbridge , hoping that the audience won\\'t notice what\\'s missing . \\njust awful . \\nthe madness of king george 107 min . \\n/ not rated ========================== \\nstill wondering who nigel hawthorne is ? \\nthen check out his oscar- nominated work in the madness of king george , still playing in both raleigh and chapel hill . \\nstage director nicholas hytner , in a remarkable screen debut , has adapted alan bennett\\'s 1991 tragic comedy to fine effect . \\nsumptuous-looking and only mildly stuffy , the film charts the madness that plagued king george iii ( hawthorne ) almost 30 years into his reign . \\na man of no importance 98 min . \\n/ rated \" r \" ====================== \\nin suri krishnamma\\'s a man of no importance , albert finney disappears so deeply into the role of a lovable dublin bus conductor that it\\'s a shame when the film gets so serious around him . \\nhis character is a conductor with a passion for oscar wilde . \\nhe reads to his riders , and once a year , with their help , he tries to stage one of the author\\'s plays . \\nthis year it\\'s \" salome . \" \\nfor about an hour , there\\'s a sweet magic behind finney and his troupe of working-class stiffs . \\nconflict arises , but it\\'s small stuff--an administrator from the bus company here , an outraged catholic pork butcher ( michael gambon ) there . \\nbut with finney at the wheel , so to speak , the film rolls smoothly over these plot points--just like the gorgeous leland double-decker bus in the story . \\nwhere things get serious is toward the end of the film , when the plot takes a turn that the bus never would , and the story heads down a very dark alley that marks the end of an enjoyable ride . \\nthe twist makes sense--and helps paint a complete picture of finney\\'s character--but the trip to get there betrays the light , airy atmosphere of what had come before . \\nit\\'s not a fatal misstep , mind you , and it doesn\\'t send the story soaring into the realms of incredulity . \\nit\\'s just a turn off . \\ndr . strangelove 93 min . \\n/ not rated =============== \\nmein fuhrer ! \\nthe most fun that * i * had last month was in durham , at the carolina , at a mid-week screening of stanley kubrick\\'s pitch-black comedy dr . \\nstrangelove ( or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb ) . \\nthe 1964 film stars peter sellers ( in three roles ) , george c . scott , sterling hayden , and slim pickens . \\ntheir antics brought the house down , which , to my surprise , was packed by an audience younger than the film . \\n', b' \" snake eyes \" is the most aggravating kind of movie : the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing . \\nit\\'s not just because this is a brian depalma film , and since he\\'s a great director and one who\\'s films are always greeted with at least some fanfare . \\nand it\\'s not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage and since he gives a brauvara performance , this film is hardly worth his talents . \\nit\\'s worse than that . \\nit\\'s aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more , could be totally intelligent , and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely . . . then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of half-assedness . \\nor more deservedly , the hall of fame of the eighth-assedness . \\nin certain circles , \" snake eyes \" was being advertised as a kind of modern day version of kurosawa\\'s classic \" rashomon , \" where a crime is told from the four different ( and i mean different ) perspectives , and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening , which , i might add , is superb . \\nin one very very very long steadicam shot , we meet the protagonist , crooked atlantic city detective , rick santoro ( cage ) , and follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife , interupts a pay-per-view event on tv , chases down a gambler , enters the arena all pumped up for the fight , sits down and talks with his bud , kevin dunne ( gary sinise , who\\'s character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn , who\\'s also in this ) , and watches as it happens . \\nthere\\'s a big name in the crowd , and that\\'s the secretary of defense , charles kirkland ( joel fabiani ) , who\\'s sitting behind rick , and who gets shot a second after the heavyweight champion , lincoln tyler ( stan shaw ) , is knocked out . \\nthis all happens in the opening shot , and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction . \\nwhat really happened , this film asks , and it sets this film up extremely well for when rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene . . . and \\ndiscovers there\\'s a very good possibility it was a conspiracy . \\nas we follow rick trying to learn of more information , we also meet a woman who was talking to kirkland before he was shot ( carla gugino ) , and who flees the scene in a panic , and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casino/hotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness\\' takes on what happened . \\nthis is all going pretty fine and dandy , and it\\'s extremely interesting to watch . . . then \\nit takes one wrong step . \\nwe follow the wrong character , and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on , and way before rick can find it out . \\nbut that\\'s not the worst part of it : it\\'s that it\\'s the one person you didn\\'t think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring , the one you didn\\'t think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it . \\nit only gets worse : the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film , and since we already know what happened , we can\\'t rely on rick\\'s investigation to be all that interesting . \\nit\\'s as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about a third of the way in , and decided to just fall back on an easy way out , and that just happens to mean that it has to become less and less credible . \\nevents become more and more proposterous , and by the end , the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this : the deux ex machina . \\nthat\\'s where some outside intereference brings the film to a sudden conclusion and makes everything okay . \\nthis time , it\\'s a hurricane , an out-of-control police car , and a big round ball that adorned the arena . \\nwhat went wrong ? \\ndepalma and the screenwriter , david koepp , are extremely credible people in their respective fields , and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this . \\ndepalma , who idolizes hitchcock to death , has done many a film like this , such as his masterpiece , \" blow out , \" where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece . \\nbut granted , depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch , what with his over-the-top shot set-ups , notably the beginning and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel , forgetting anything about boundaries . \\nat least his direction makes up partly for it . \\nthen there\\'s koepp , who showed such great ability at making a character\\'s flaws come to life like he did in depalma\\'s earlier \" carlito\\'s way , \" a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well . \\nhe can write a flawed character , but his rick santoro seems to be just a half-assed effort . \\nhe\\'s flawed , and we can see redemption if the story wasn\\'t so formulaic . \\na scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup . \\nhe may as well have said the opposite of what he says ; it would have at least gone with what the character was like . \\nthis is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity , because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption , then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way . \\nas i was watching the first half hour , i couldn\\'t wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed , how many different perspectives he\\'d be given , and perhaps he\\'d have to make a choice between who\\'s he has to believe . \\nnow there\\'s a film . \\nunfortunately , the film has two major deux ex machinas : one in the disasterous ending ; the other , about a half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes a stale and recycled piece of crap we\\'ve seen all too much before , but never from someone like depalma . \\n', b'every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio , with every indication that it will be a stinker , and to everybody\\'s surprise ( perhaps even the studio ) the film becomes a critical darling . \\nmtv films\\' _election , a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon , is a current example . \\ndid anybody know this film existed a week before it opened ? \\nthe plot is deceptively simple . \\ngeorge washington carver high school is having student elections . \\ntracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an over-achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question , way , way , high . \\nmr . \" m \" ( matthew broderick ) , sick of the megalomaniac student , encourages paul , a popular-but-slow jock to run . \\nand paul\\'s nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well , for personal reasons . \\nthe dark side of such sleeper success is that , because expectations were so low going in , the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be . \\nyou can\\'t help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews , which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have . \\n_election , a good film , does not live up to its hype . \\nwhat makes _election_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from _rushmore_ , released a few months earlier . \\nthe similarities are staggering : \\ntracy flick ( _election_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . \\nmax fischer ( _rushmore_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . \\nthe most significant tension of _election_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . \\nthe most significant tension of _rushmore_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . \\ntracy flick is from a single parent home , which has contributed to her drive . \\nmax fischer is from a single parent home , which has contributed to his drive . \\nthe male bumbling adult in _election_ ( matthew broderick ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . \\nhe even gets a bee sting . \\nthe male bumbling adult in _rushmore_ ( bill murray ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . \\nhe gets several bee stings . \\nand so on . \\nwhat happened ? \\nhow is it that an individual screenplay ( _rushmore_ ) and a novel ( _election_ ) contain so many significant plot points , and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other , made from two different studios , from a genre ( the high school geeks revenge movie ) that hadn\\'t been fully formed yet ? \\neven so , the strengths of _election_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick , witherspoon , and newcomer jessica campbell , as paul\\'s anti-social sister , tammy . \\nbroderick here is playing the mr . rooney role from _ferris bueller_ , and he seems to be having the most fun he\\'s had since then . \\nwitherspoon is a revelation . \\nit\\'s early in the year , it\\'s a comedy , and teenagers have little clout , but for my money , witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination . \\nand once campbell\\'s character gets going , like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium , then you\\'re won over . \\none thing that\\'s been bothering me since i\\'ve seen it . \\nthere is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film . \\ni suppose that , coming from mtv films , i should expect no less . . . \\nbut the film starts off light and airy , like a sitcom . \\nas the screws tighten , and the tensions mount , alexander payne decides to add elements that , frankly , distract from the story . \\nit is bad enough that mr . m doesn\\'t like tracy\\'s determination to win at all costs , but did they have to throw in the student/teacher relationship ? \\neven so , there\\'s no logical reason why mr . m has an affair when he does . \\nthere\\'s a lot to like in _election_ , but the plot similarities to _rushmore_ , and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex-driven , mark this as a disappointment . \\n', b\"best remembered for his understated performance as dr . hannibal lecter in michael mann's forensics thriller , manhunter , scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on . \\nusually playing a bit role in some studio schlock ( he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight ) , he's only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do . \\nif you want to see some brilliant acting , check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach's hidden agenda . \\ncox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l . i . e . , which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge . \\nbig john feels the love that dares not speak its name , but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad . \\nwhat bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light . \\nhe's an even-tempered , funny , robust old man who actually listens to the kids' problems ( as opposed to their parents and friends , both caught up in the high-wire act of their own confused lives . ) \\nhe'll have sex-for-pay with them only after an elaborate courtship , charming them with temptations from the grown-up world . \\nl . i . e . stands for long island expressway , which slices through the strip malls and middle-class homes of suburbia . \\nfilmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a ( pretty transparent ) metaphor of dangerous escape for his 15-year old protagonist , howie ( paul franklin dano ) . \\nin his opening voice-over , howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road , citing the l . i . e . \\nhighway deaths of filmmaker alan j . pakula , songwriter harry chapin , and his own mother on exit 52 . \\nhe's both fascinated and disturbed by the l . i . e . , and those feelings are projected onto big john ( who follows howie around in his bright red car , but never makes a move to force the boy to do something he doesn't want to do . \\nthis makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies -- he's a beast , but ashamed of it . ) \\nl . i . e . would have worked best as a half-hour short film about howie's ill-advised foray into big john's haven . \\nthere is unnecessary padding with howie's miserable dad ( bruce altman ) in the hot seat for a white-collar crime , degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middle-class houses , and some homoerotic shenanigans with wise-ass gary terrio ( billy kay ) , a handsome artful dodger . \\nrather than add to the themes of suburban ennui ( not that we needed another movie on that subject ) , these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length . \\nconcurrently , the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted . \\ncox , sporting a baseball cap and a faded marine tattoo , is all bluff and bluster . \\ndano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent . \\nwe're so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious ( calling haley joel ! ) , it's surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene . \\nthe restraint is admirable . \\nbut l . i . e . 's screenplay doesn't always give them the best material . \\nwhen howie reads big john a walt whitman poem , the moment feels a bit too precious . \\ndirector michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john , who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bach's goldberg variations . \\nit's too much . \\nthere are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big john's other boy toy ( walter masterson ) , jealous over the newbie . \\nthis plot thread predictably leads to violence . \\nnot content to be a haunting , observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world ( like terry zwigoff's superb ghost world ) , cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note . \\nit's typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet , sparing the writers from actually having to come up with a complex , philosophical note . \\nin this regard , l . i . e . \\n ( and countless other indie films ) share something in common with blockbuster action films : problems are solved when the obstacle is removed . \\nhow often does real life work this way ? \\nto extend the question : if a movie is striving for realism , do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion ? \\n\", b'some movies i should just skip . \\nmy daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back , and here comes another disney effects-filled live-action flick based on an old tv program . \\ntrue , the probgram is only 15 years old this time , and it\\'s a cartoon . \\nbut it\\'s a cartoon i liked , and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen . \\nbut my daughter really wanted to go , and how bad could it be ? \\nturns out i was right , mostly . \\ninspector gadget , oddly enough , follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian , down to the jive-talking side-kick . \\nat first i thought it was done by the same people , but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin , where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver . \\nthis odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it , where \" formula \" isn\\'t just business , it\\'s a way of life . \\nthe producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits . \\nin some parts you can just hear them saying \" more zany ! \\ni want more zany here -- and -- here . \" \\n \" let\\'s have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here -- make it really painful . \\ni want the audience squirming in their seats . \" \\n \" ok , that\\'s fine , but i want you to add bug guts . \" \\n \" what does this scene do ? \\ncharacter depth ? \\nbut where\\'s the zaniness ? \\ni don\\'t see zany here . \\nif you can\\'t make it zany , cut it ! \" \\nthe latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie . \\nmichelle ( who plays penny , gadget\\'s niece ) shines in every scene she\\'s in , but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time . \\nmy guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor . \\ndabney coleman\\'s comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby . \\ni kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film , but instead , he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes . \\nhe is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the \" gidget bitch from hell \" town mayor . \\noteri\\'s overly enthusiastic and continually self-congratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland , oregon\\'s own manic mayor vera katz that i had to wonder if the studio wasn\\'t poking fun at our fair town . \\nor , maybe all career politicians are like that . \\ni must say , matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla . \\nhe appears to have some fun with the film , especially as the evil gadget . \\nrupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw . \\njoely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself . \\nher performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film . \\nd . l . hughley plays the shuckin\\'-and-jivin\\' vehicular side-kick , in a role that firmly sets emancipation back 20 years . \\nthe dialog is . . . let\\'s face it , it\\'s pretty bad . \\nthe tag-line after a major set-piece battle is a faux pas that makes no sense in context . \\na lot of the lines ( especially hughley\\'s ) appear to be made up as they go along , by people with little gift for ad-lib . \\nabout three-quarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw . \\ngadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations ( not really \" battles \" ) with the evil gadget . \\npenny does about a minute and a half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon . \\nlet me rage here just for a minute . \\nmichelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character . \\nshe\\'s utterly charming , and has excellent experience ( harriet the spy ) for the part of the pint-size detective . \\nwhy she is so underutilized in this film is a real mystery . \\nthe film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting ( or editing ) stupidity . \\ninspector gadget is missing the long , long stretches of potty humor that ( among other things ) made my favorite martian so unbearable , but it\\'s a very short movie , so perhaps something was cut at the last moment . \\nprobably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits . \\nthe \" evil sidekick support group \" is especially worth seeing , and has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds it\\'s onscreen . \\nall in all , another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action films . \\ni wonder if disney uses the revenues for it\\'s generally money-making cartoons to produce these losers . \\nbut if true , why ? \\nif they\\'re trying for another mary poppins , they need to find a team that can produce one , and then give them a chance to do it . \\n', b'at first glance , it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds . \\nthat\\'s true of home alone 2 and i\\'d bet money that it\\'s true of home alone 3 ( opening soon ) . \\nbut home alone actually has a lot going for it , and the cartoon slapstick doesn\\'t get in the way . \\nthe mcalisters , all 15 of them , are going to france for the holidays . \\nfour adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse . \\nthe littlest kid , kevin , is the victim of the older kids\\' cruelty . \\nkevin\\'s patience runs out when he learns that his plain-cheese pizza has already been eaten , and he\\'s going to have to starve . \\nhe attacks his big bully brother buzz , who had been teasing him . \\nthe fight disrupts the already-chaotic dinner , spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table , a few cousins , and an uncle . \\nthe knee-jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin . \\nnobody came to his rescue when he was being teased , but they all point their fingers when he fights back . \\nthe ultimate punishment comes from mom ( catherine o\\'hara ) who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night . \\non his way up the stairs , he tells her that \" families suck \" and that he hopes never to see any of his family again . \\nthat night the power goes out , knocking out the alarm clocks , so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport . \\nin a surprisingly plausible setup , kevin is mistakenly accounted for , and the family heads off without him . \\nit\\'s interesting that , in a subtle way , his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children . \\nfirst they delegate the headcount to an older sibling , and second , they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class . \\nthey\\'re two-thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child . \\nmeanwhile , kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true . \\nhe\\'s finally rid of his family ! \\nlife is a dream come true . \\nhe can jump on the beds , watch r-rated movies , eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips , and dig through his big brother\\'s secret box . \\nslowly , the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane . \\nhe grooms himself , he does the laundry , he goes shopping ( \" i bought some milk , eggs , and fabric softener \" ) . \\nhe also starts to miss his family , not just for their company , but for the security they bring . \\nthe furnace in the basement is a scary monster , the old man next door is a snow-shovel murderer , and two crooks are trying to break into his house . \\nmacaulay culkin is cute but he isn\\'t much of an actor . \\nstill , we can see that kevin\\'s character grows , thanks to some good direction and editing . \\nfor example , acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night , just as \" santa \" is getting in his car . \\nkevin asks the man to pass on his request - he wants his family back - to the real santa . \\nhe learned how to deal with the furnace . \\nyou turn on the lights and it\\'s not so scary anymore . \\nhe goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snow-shovel murderer , who actually turns out to be a nice man . \\nthey talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid . \\nfinally , in the last 20 minutes , kevin confronts his last fear - the bandits , head on ( literally ) . \\nthis last act is full of violent comedic slapstick , and after the movie\\'s genuine dramatic setup , it is dessert . \\nit\\'s a lot of fun , and it doesn\\'t overwhelm the rest of the movie . \\non the whole , home alone is a great holiday movie . \\njohn williams\\' original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls , and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings . \\nbut it does have its flaws . \\nthe smallest problem is that culkin doesn\\'t act very well . \\nas i said before , he is cute , but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkin\\'s insight into his character . \\nthe biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda , the villains threaten kevin\\'s life about five times . \\ninstead of \" i\\'m gonna get that kid \" they say \" i\\'m gonna kill that kid . \" \\nsome might argue that the tone is the same , but i strongly disagree . \\nmixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux-pas . \\ni\\'ll probably never see home alone 3 , and i wish i had skipped home alone 2 , but i do enjoy home alone almost every year . \\ndon\\'t let your impressions of the others detract from the original , which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick . \\n', b'synopsis : bobby garfield ( yelchin ) lives in a small town with his mirthless widowed mother ( hope davis ) . \\nbobby\\'s world revolves around his friends , especially the spritely carol ( boorem ) . \\nthen one day , a new boarder arrives at bobby\\'s house . \\nted brautigan ( hopkins ) is an enigmatic man to whom bobby takes an immediate liking . \\nas the bond between bobby and ted deepens , bobby becomes privy to ted\\'s great secret , an event which will change both of their lives forever . \\nreview : a small but enchanting movie , \" hearts in atlantis \" easily recalls another king-inspired coming-of-age film , \" stand by me \" , both in terms of its setting and the sentiment it conveys . \\n \" hearts \" is a tribute to the magic of childhood , to those summers when the days seem neverending , and nothing means more than your closest friends . \\nunlike \" stand by me \" , there is a supernatural element to \" hearts \" , but although it is key to the plot , it is not prominent . \\nlike \" stand by me \" , this is a mostly character-driven film , and as such it benefits greatly from superb casting . \\nyelchin is very good as bobby , finding a good mix of innocence and resignation . \\nmore splendid still is boorem , whom i praised highly for her work in \" along came a spider \" and who is simply radiant here as carol . \\nand then there is hopkins , who despite playing such a quiet , introspective character as ted , nonetheless commands our attention every time he is onscreen . \\nless successful is davis , whose strident elizabeth comes across as overly cartoonish . \\ni also found it odd that bobby and carol\\'s other friend , sully ( whose death as an adult sets up the movie\\'s flashback framing device ) , is paid virtually no attention . \\nbut hicks\\' direction is lovely without being cloying , and despite the movie\\'s general lack of incident , it never ceases to weave its spell over the audience . \\n', b\"apparently , director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film , american history x . i don't know the details of the fight , but it seems that he is not happy with the final product , and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether . \\ni've heard about this kind of thing happening before , and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce . \\nas it is , i found american history x to be an extremely good film , not just because of tony kaye's focused look at the touchy subject of racism , but because of a powerful , charismatic performance from edward norton . \\nit's hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton's fantastic role in primal fear , but , here he is now , starring in his own film and making himself a star . \\nnorton is one of those performers who becomes his character , and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year . \\nhe plays a young man named derek vinyard , a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother , danny ( edward furlong ) , mother ( beverly d'angelo ) , and sister , davin ( jennifer lien ) . \\nthe film opens with a flashback , in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car . \\nwe find out that this lands him in prison , and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny . \\nin the present-time of the film , danny is in high school , and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother . \\nmuch of the film is told in flashback , and we see the path that leads to derek's adoption of white supremacy . \\nwhen derek is released , having served three years in prison , he finds that his brother is now a full-blown skinhead ; derek , however , has given up the violence , and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things . \\nwhat makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid , thoughtless people -- they are intelligent and articulate , and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms . \\nit's hard to make a controversial movie and not preach , but kaye has found the right note for his material . \\nbecause american history x is a mainstream film , there has to be a redemption phase for our main character -- some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic . \\ni partially disagree with this , because , although i do not advocate racism in any way , it's interesting the way kaye presents derek -- he is a loud , obnoxious man , but he's also very smart . \\nthe reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable -- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men . \\nit's clear that he's passionate about his beliefs , and that he's not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up . \\nof course , it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part . \\nit's astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest . \\nin addition to getting the look just right , he's perfect for this role -- derek requires intelligence , depth , and a whole lot of shouting , and norton does it all with ease . \\neven when he's at his meanest , derek has a likable quality to him , and that's a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead . \\nwhat adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny's school ( avery brooks ) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny . \\nthe other performances are all terrific , with standouts from furlong , d'angelo , and lien . \\nvisually , the film is very powerful . \\nkaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices , and most of them work nicely -- lots of slow-motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere . \\nbut , like a lot of movies lately , american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes . \\nalthough the climactic scene is very moving , the picture ends with a pretentious , preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed . \\nfor a movie so smart a subtle up until that point , it felt like a slap in the face to be hand-fed a theme in such a simplistic way . \\nit makes me wonder what , exactly , tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film . \\nperhaps this last scene was the problem . \\nit's hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good -- in a time when so many movies are timid and weak , american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way . \\n\", b'the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola\\'s 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia , which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages . \\nmartin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime . \\nunfortunately for scorsese , his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola\\'s influence on mafia portrayals in the movies . \\nseventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime . \\nthis film was goodfellas , epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s . \\ngoodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story , told in best-seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi ( who would co-write the screenplay for the film ) . \\nthe book , as well as the film , chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill ( played by ray liotta ) , irish-italian criminal from new york . \\nat the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero ( played by paul sorvino ) , local mob boss , and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands . \\nafter couple of years , together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito ( played by joe pesci ) , he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway ( played by robert de niro ) . \\nthree of them spend years as best friends and associates , gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history . \\nwealth , influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen ( played by lorraine bracco ) , who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities , domestic abuse , arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business . \\nbut the perfect world of \" wiseguys \" gradually begins to fall apart - tommy\\'s unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence , jimmy\\'s reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and , finally , henry\\'s own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends . \\ngoodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory . \\nscorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker . \\nworld depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating . \\nscorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence , hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime , yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny . \\nafter being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history ( based on some notorious real life events ) , the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths , trading the superficial and short-lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens . \\nscorsese also manages to break viewer\\'s moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal tragedies , broken homes , human depravity , violence , bloodshed and murder - in all their uncompromising reality , but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience . \\nwith the use of ironic soundtrack , manipulative shots , character\\'s dialogue or narrator\\'s commentary , goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era . \\neven if we don\\'t pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining , we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker . \\nfirst , we might notice unusual structure of the plot - relatively minor subplot is used as movie\\'s ironic prologue . \\nthen , instead of single narrator , scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards . \\nthis multiple points of views , both in terms of narration and various subjective shots , only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation . \\nsame ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack . \\nnostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy-listening 1950s pop songs , while depression , paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s . \\nbut the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment - almost pastoral , easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed . \\nhowever , thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people . \\nsuch scenes , although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings , became very popular among other directors in 1990s . \\nfragmentary character of the screenplay , which doesn\\'t have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes , gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese . \\nhe uses this structure of film to experiment , and most successful of such experiments is hilarious \" a day in life \" segment near the end of the film . \\nanother essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents . \\nthe most respectable among them is robert de niro , but his character , who happen to be most quiet and business-like member of criminal trio , gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues . \\njoe pesci deserved his \" oscar \" for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy , and his lines , including ad-libs , probably represent the most memorable element of the film . \\nray liotta , although equally talented , perhaps doesn\\'t look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film . \\nliotta\\'s henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low-level street thugs . \\nliotta , on the other hand , improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction . \\nlorraine bracco is , on the other hand , very effective and believable as karen hill , wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband . \\npaul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso , and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small-time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave . \\nas a combination of clever sociological study , black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do - work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time . \\nbecause of this achievement , and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers , this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s . \\n', b'unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi , an artist whose palette is fabric . \\nostensibly , the film is a documentary , but use of that term requires stretching its meaning . \\nmany scenes appear staged , and a great deal of cutting-and-pasting has been done in the editing room . \\nthe cinema verite effect is a conceit -- genuine spontaneity is at a premium , and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera ( especially would-be actresses like cindy crawford ) . \\ndirector douglas keeve ( who was mizrahi\\'s lover at the time ) freely admits that he \" couldn\\'t care less about the truth \" but was more interested in capturing \" the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion . \" \\ndespite violating nearly every rule of \" legitimate \" documentary film making , however , unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment . \\nwhile it sheds only a little light on the behind-the-scenes world of the fashion industry , it presents a fascinating , if incomplete , picture of designer mizrahi . \\nthis man is the perfect subject for this kind of study -- he\\'s funny , energetic , and eminently quotable . \\nhe has unusual views on just about everything , from fashion ( \" it\\'s about women not wanting to look like cows \" ) to mary tyler moore ( \" between her and jackie kennedy , they shaped this country \" ) to style ( \" it\\'s almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs \" ) . \\nunzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress . \\nit\\'s almost certainly different that anyone would imagine . \\nthe designer draws on a variety of sources for his look , including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies , then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection . \\nin particular , unzipped traces mizrahi\\'s development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show , which highlights a number of prominent models , including cindy crawford , naomi campbell , kate bush , and linda evangelista . \\non the technical side , a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped . \\na variety of film stocks were used : super 8 , 16 mm black-and-white , and 35 mm color . \\nthere is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness -- the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie , and , during the climactic fashion show , color is used to show the audience\\'s perspective , while black-and-white is for the behind-the- scenes sequences . \\nnevertheless , some viewers will be put off by this treatment . \\nwhile unzipped isn\\'t an expose on the fashion industry per se , keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear . \\noverall , however , this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else , and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed . \\nwhen the designer declares that \" everything is frustrating except designing clothes -- that\\'s beautiful and liberating , \" it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed . \\n', b'hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell . \\nthe last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films . \\nin a nutshell , the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous . \\nwith the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership , a lot of hong kong\\'s best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u . s . productions . \\nsuch talents as jackie chan ( rush hour ) , chow yun-fat ( anna & the king , the corrupter ) and yuen woo-ping ( the matrix ) have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results . \\nnow we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai . \\nunfortunately \" romeo must die \" bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong\\'s rhythms . \\nthe film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking . \\nenter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing ( russell wong ) . \\nkai confronts po sing ( jon kit lee ) , the son of kai\\'s boss and leader of the local chinese family . \\na battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai , who handily kicks and punches his opponents down . \\nit\\'s not until club owner silk ( rapper dmx ) , bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends . \\nthe following morning po sing is found dead . \\nsuspicions escalate , as issac o\\'day ( delroy lindo ) is told of the murder . \\nhis concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture . \\nissac implores his chief of security , mac ( issiah washington ) to watch after his son and daughter . \\nthe scene shifts to a prison in china , where han sing ( jet li ) learns of his brothers murder . \\nhe fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined . \\nhung upside down by one foot , han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work . \\nescaping to the u . s . han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother\\'s death . \\n \" romeo must die \" is in many ways a fun film . \\nit is both absurd and assured . \\nthe basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes \" the godfather \" . \\nthe relationship between jet li\\'s han and aaliyah\\'s trish o\\'day reminds us of abel ferrera\\'s \" china girl \" , except that romeo must die\\'s couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another . \\ntheir romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history . \\nthe performances are adequate if not fully acceptable . \\nli , of course has the showiest part , having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination . \\nallayah , in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace . \\nit\\'s obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic . \\nbut , still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it . \\ndelro lindo as issac o\\'day carries himself well in the film . \\nan unsung and under appreciated actor , mr . lindo turns out the films best performance . \\nthe other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d . b . woodside as issac\\'s son , colin . \\nthe performance is undirected , with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in . \\nan unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and / or better written . \\nfirst time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film . \\nhaving a career as one of the industry\\'s best cinematographers , bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots , and \" romeo must die \" does look good . \\nbut the pacing of the film is lethargic , only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes . \\nthe script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in . \\nthe big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing . \\nand of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayah\\'s bodyguard , maurice has no comic timing whatsoever . \\nthe best things about the film are its fight scenes . \\njet li is a master of these intricate physical battles . \\none needs only to see his film \" fist of legend \" to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat . \\nhere , jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that \" lethal weapon 4 \" ( jet\\'s u . s . debut ) didn\\'t allow . \\nunfortunately , a lot of jet\\'s fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision . \\nalso \" romeo must die \" must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film , and that is an x-ray effect that appears three times during the course of the film , showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent . \\nobviously a homage to the famed x-ray scene from sonny chiba\\'s \" streetfighter \" , the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film . \\nit\\'s as if the film has stopped and a video game has been inserted . \\none problem though about the fight scenes . \\nthose that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon . \\nthey do have an internal rhythm to them . \\na heartbeat , so to speak in their choreography . \\nthe fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance . \\nthis is created by the performance , the direction and the editing . \\nhere in \" romeo must die \" , there is no staccato . \\nevery fight scene , even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows a set pattern . \\nthe rhythm is monotonous . \\na hong kong film has a tempo that changes , heightening its emotional impact . \\n\\'rmd\\' is limited to a standard 4/4 tempo , not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever . \\na fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chan\\'s films . . \\nwatch the restaurant fight from the film \" rush hour \" and notice that the context of the fight , while technically amazing is rather flat ( the framing and cut always do not help ) . \\nnow look at the warehouse fight from \" rumble in the bronx \" . \\nthere you have a heartbeat , and emotional draw that doesn\\'t let the audience catch its breath . \\nthe stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly , causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted . \\nhere in \\'romeo must die\\' , the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl . \\njet li is a grand and personable screen presence . \\nit\\'s a shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here . \\none day filmmakers here in the u . s . will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such a commodity . \\nuntil then , we\\'ll be left with emotionally hollow product like \" the replacement killer \" and , currently \" romeo must die \" . \\n', b'plot : derek zoolander is a male model . \\nhe is also very dumb and impressionable . \\nfor that reason , he is secretly hired and trained ( so secret , that even he doesn\\'t know about it ) by an underground fashion syndicate to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia , who wants to abolish child labor in his country . \\nwill zoolander fulfill the dirty deed ? \\nwill zoolander ever grace the world his new \" look \" ? \\nis this a funny movie ? \\nfind out below . . . \\ncritique : there\\'s a place in our world for \" stupid comedies \" . \\nfilms which don\\'t pretend to take themselves seriously , are based on idiotic premises and filled with dumb jokes . \\nthere\\'s also a time for them and many would argue that this difficult period of our history , might be an ideal circumstance during which to \" relax \" by watching something so completely frivolous . \\nwell , if you\\'re in the mood for some seriously mindless entertainment , ben stiller and his cast of many have assembled one of the more original dumb comedies in some time . \\nof course , comedies as such are usually very subjective and i could see how some will see this film simply as stupid and unfunny , while others will grant them the \" stupid \" , but consider it funny instead . \\ni personally enjoyed it for the most part , cracked up loudly during a couple of specific sequences and loved the derek zoolander character and the unrestrained whipping they released upon the fashion industry . \\nsnap ! \\nit was also nice to see several real-life models with small roles in the movie , not taking themselves too seriously . \\nand if you\\'re the type of person who likes celebrity cameos in films , well , don\\'t look any further because dozens of famous faces show up here including vince vaughn , billy zane , winona ryder , christian slater , david duchovny , natalie portman and many , many others . \\ni especially liked andy dick\\'s complete make-over as the masseuse . \\nhi-larious ! \\nbut with all films of this type , there is bound to be some stuff that simply doesn\\'t work . \\na few particulars which didn\\'t strike my fancy included the bulimia and \" orgy \" sequence with christine taylor , the break-dance fighting , and i also never get why they use real countries in plots like this ( why not just \" make up \" a country , instead of zeroing in on a certain people ? ) . \\ni also could have done with less of the taylor character in general , since she wasn\\'t all that interesting and seemed to slow things down every now and then ( more zoolander , dude ! ) . \\nbut those few missteps were nothing compared to some of the more memorable scenes which definitely did work for me ! \\ni almost pissed myself during the \" gas station \" disaster , absolutely adored the \" walk-off \" contest ( with david bowie as the judge , no less ) and appreciated many of zoolander\\'s moronic one-liners ( \" i was a merman . . . a \\nmerman ! ! \" ) . \\nand i dare you to get his \" monkey \" photo shoot out of your head after seeing this movie ( \" you\\'re a monkey , derek . . . a \\nmonkey ! \" ) \\ni also really liked the soundtrack and the pace of the film , both of which zipped and zagged , and established a nice rhythm to it all . \\nagain , it\\'s to note that this movie is dumb and not for everyone , but my guess is that if you laughed at the trailer , you will likely enjoy many of the quips in the actual picture as well . \\nif you thought the trailer was dumb , skip this dodo bird and go rent austin powers again or something , a film from which there is an obvious influence here . \\nblue steel , baby . . . yeah ! ! ! \\nwhere\\'s joblo coming from ? \\naustin powers ( 7/10 ) - austin powers 2 ( 7/10 ) - deuce bigalow ( 7/10 ) - dude , where\\'s my car ( 7/10 ) - freddy got fingered ( 5/10 ) - jay & silent bob strike back ( 8/10 ) - joe dirt ( 5/10 ) - meet the parents ( 8/10 ) - say it isn\\'t so ( 3/10 ) \\n', b'she was the femme in \" la femme nikita . \" \\nhe was the baldwin in \" backdraft , \" \" sliver , \" and \" fair game \" ( with cindy crawford ) . \\ntogether , anne parillaud and william baldwin conspire to make \" shattered image \" the biggest piece of hooey since the stallone/stone \" thriller \" \" the specialist . \" \\nthe film poses the question \" what if the life you\\'re living now is really a dream , and your dreams reality ? \" \\nit\\'s either about a woman who\\'s haunted by a recurring ( and recurring and recurring ) nightmare that she\\'s a hired assassin , or it\\'s about a hired assassin who\\'s haunted by a recurring ( and recurring and recurring ) nightmare that she\\'s honeymooning with william baldwin in jamaica . \\nit doesn\\'t much matter and believe me by the time \" shattered image \" runs its painful and pedestrian course you won\\'t care . \\nthese two lives , with parillaud looking like siouxsie sioux with a black wig , black emotionless eyes , and black leather clothing in the seattle-based assassin scenes , and moping around like karen carpenter in the jamaica scenes , play out endlessly throughout the film and the result is it\\'s now * twice * as boring as it might have been . \\nit\\'s not that complicated plots can\\'t be entertaining . \\nof course it helps if you have interesting characters , crisp dialogue , and a modicum of style . \\n \" shattered image \" isn\\'t complex , it\\'s just stupid . \\nand boring . \\nparillaud and baldwin , who aren\\'t exactly shakespearean material to begin with , are saddled with such leaden dialogue that their characters have zero chance of breaking free of their cardboard confines . \\nlines like : \\n \" you don\\'t beg , you insist . \\ni like that in a woman . \" \\nthat\\'s parillaud\\'s character talking . . . \\nto her cat ! \\nand : \\n \" you\\'re not the reason i couldn\\'t care less about you . \" \\nhuh ? \\nand this wonderful bathroom interchange early in the film : \\n \" if you give me a couple of minutes you know i\\'ll charm the pants off you . \" \\n \" i don\\'t have that kind of time . \" \\ntalking of pants , parillaud has her clothes off faster than you can say \" point of no return . \" \\nwe have come to expect this from billy baldwin , but it might have been nice to have learned something about their characters first . \\nbut there\\'s nothing to learn . \\nkaren is as interesting as a cereal box , a someone\\'s-out-to-get-me crybaby who imagines the voice at the other end of the phone , the stranger who sends her flowers , maybe even her husband himself , is her would-be killer . \\nsiouxsie is the chromium cool , tough-as-nails crack killing machine who shoots out a couple of mirrors in order to justify the film\\'s meaningless stock title . \\nbaldwin seems more interested in parillaud\\'s nest egg ( so that he can pave paradise and put up a parking lot ) than he does in her . \\neach time graham greene shows up he gets killed . \\nbarbet schroeder ( \" reversal of fortune \" ) co-produced and should be ashamed of himself . \\nevery now and again it\\'s fun to watch a really bad movie . \\nand every now and again , as \" shattered image \" makes agonizingly clear , it isn\\'t . \\n', b'by phil curtolo mel gibson ( braveheart ) gave a gripping performance as the father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howard\\'s ransom . \\ngibson plays tom mullen , a wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as a deranged psychopath , played by gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , and his band of low-life thugs kidnap his only son for $2 million . \\ntom and his wife , kate , played by rene russo ( tin cup ) were instructed not to inform the police , but they contacted the fbi . \\nminutes later , an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo ( broken arrow ) are in tom\\'s house and wiring every phone . \\nthe plot sounds average , just like most other kidnap movies that you\\'ve already seen , and it was nothing more than that . \\nthat is until about half-way through the movie . \\nsuddenly , tom goes to the fox 5 news room and makes a live broadcast saying , \" this is your ransom . \\nbut this is as close as you will ever get to it . \\ninstead , i am offering this money as a reward on your head , dead or alive . \" \\nat this point , the plot thickened , and the unusually slow start of the film turned into a suspense-filled action film with great stunts . \\nthe last half of the film is very well done . \\nanother thing that carries this film are the superb performances by gibson and sinise , as they collide in a game of wits over their cellular phones for most of the movie . \\nowen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject : \" it makes you wonder what kidnappers did before cell phones . \" \\nbefore this movie , sinise played mostly \" good guys , \" first in of mice & men , then in forrest gump , and most recently , in apollo 13 . \\nbut he was surprisingly devilish and cold in his portrayal of a cop-gone-bad . \\ngibson , of course , was just being gibson , in an oscar-worthy performance . \\nalthough most of the scenes were quite predictable , ransom is a very entertaining and suspenseful film . \\n , \\n', b'mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we actually get to see a great big gorilla . \\nhis entrance , however , is a grand one : out from the trees he leaps , gargantuan and imposing , sporting hands big enough to crush a volkswagen bug , and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have . \\njoe bellows at the poachers before him , angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for millions of dollars . \\nduring this scene , i turned to my friend and said , \" wow . \\nthat\\'s some ape . \" \\njoe is quite a gorilla -- a big , digital gorilla . \\nhe runs around the fields , chasing cars and people . \\nhe picks things up and stares at them pensively . \\nhe breaks things on accident , because he\\'s just too big to avoid clumsiness . \\njoe , as a special effect , is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes . \\nas a character , he doesn\\'t quite register . \\nand the story he\\'s been put in is as limp as they come . \\nthe words \" family entertainment \" have never been a stamp of quality , but might joe young is just a silly special effects movie pretending to have a heart . \\nthe picture is a remake of the 1949 film . \\nit\\'s mostly just about the big gorilla , but , strictly as a formality , the movie also has a few human characters . \\nthe main one is jill young ( poor charlize theron , forced to waste her talent ) , a lover of gorillas . \\nas a child , she witnessed a group of poachers murder her mother ; now , she lives in the jungle to protect the wildlife . \\nspecifically , she\\'s out to protect joe , a giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood . \\nsoon , zoologist gregg o\\'hara ( bill paxton ) discovers joe ; he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser ( rade sherbedgia ) , who just happens to be the same guy who killed jill\\'s mother . \\nso , in an effort to save joe , jill and gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve , where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poachers . \\nin addition , the space is way too small for him ( after all , he is a really big gorilla ) . \\nand , to add to the complications , strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext ( he tells jill that he has a preserve big enough for joe ) , and joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jill\\'s mother . \\njill , of course , doesn\\'t recognize strasser , even though he did kill her mother . \\nthis is just one of the many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young , a film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with a special effects film . \\nthe movie isn\\'t really offensive -- it has some competent actors , a few nifty sets , and a lot of scenes with a big , digitized gorilla . \\nbut the story is really dumb , there aren\\'t any characters , and the film isn\\'t satisfying on any level beyond its visuals . \\nthe movie also has bad dialogue . \\nif a critic says that a film has bad dialogue , it\\'s only fair to quote some of it , but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like \" joe isn\\'t happy ! \" \\nand \" joe isn\\'t safe here ! \" \\n \" we need to get joe out of here ! \" \\n \" joe is way too big for that cage ! \" \\ni don\\'t know if these phrases are word for word , but they\\'re close . \\nas i said , the characters here are only present as a formality : they do little more than state the obvious ( of * course * joe is too big for that cage ) . \\npaxton and theron are talented performers who deserve to work on a script that provides characters for them . \\nsadly , mighty joe young wastes them both . \\nthere are a few clever moments ( although none of them are surfacing in my memory at the moment ) , and , as i said , the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes . \\nit\\'s certainly not a bad film for kids ; i doubt joe will give them nightmares . \\nbut adults in the audience aren\\'t likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla . \\na big gorilla is only interesting for a little while ; after that , something needs to be done with the big gorilla . \\nnobody ever figures out what to do with the big gorilla . \\n', b'one-sided \" doom and gloom \" documentary about the possible annihilation of the human race as foretold by the bible . \\norson welles narrates and appears in the film in which he , along with best-selling author hal lindsey , discusses various prophecies from the bible and relates them to recent ( well for 1976 anyway ) events . \\nthe film is dated badly , as many things that are supposed to happen in the \" future \" never do . \\nfor example , the planets of the solar system were supposed to line up in the year 1982 and cause chaos here on earth . \\nwe\\'re still here . \\nthe arms race between the soviets and america was supposed to kick-off the apocalypse . \\nwe\\'re still here . \\nsome of the more ludicrous moments come when it\\'s alluded to that people like jimmy carter and henry kissinger may actually be the antichrist ( ! ) . \\nalso , there\\'s ten minutes of stock footage at the end of the film meant to give us an idea of what the battle for armageddon might be like . \\nif it\\'s anything like it\\'s depicted as here then it\\'s going to be incredibly boring . \\nthe late great planet earth is available on dvd from vci home video . \\nit contains the film in standard form ( aspect ratio of 1 . 33 : 1 ) , although some moments of stock footage are letterboxed . \\nalso included are brief bios on orson welles and hal lindsey , as well as a trailer for another recent vci home video release , chariots of the gods . \\naudio is mono dolby digital , and the video is fair to good for a film like this . \\ni believe this is the first appearance of this film on any home video format so any condition at all is fine with me . \\ncertainly i never expected a remastered print . \\ncuriously , the menu screens on this dvd look nothing like the menu screens pictured on the back of the case . \\nbut they\\'re menu screens . . . \\nso who really cares ? \\n[pg] \\n', b' \" the world on land -- it\\'s just too big for me . \" \\nstarring tim roth ,

that he might be taken away from him because of \" visa matters . \" \\nwell , when 1900 is about 9 or so , he starts wondering all around the ship . \\none day , he discovers a grand piano . \\nhe

\\nafter that , 1900 and max become friends . \\nmax is determined to get 1900 off the ship and discover what he is missing on land , but 1900 has no intention of doing so . \\nwhat\\'s more , he doesn\\'t even want his music to go anywhere without him : when a record company hears about his talents , they come on board to make a record of his music , but after finding out that -- gasp ! \\n-- they\\'re going to make millions of copies , he breaks the record . \\nthe conflict of the movie is that after max , unsuccessful in his endeavor to get 1900 off the ship , gets off himself , he stumbles upon a record of 1900\\'s music in a store . \\nthe record shouldn\\'t exist because a ) 1900 never stepped on dry land and b ) the one record that was made on the ship was broken . \\nladies

comic relief here and there to liven things up a bit . \\nthe highlight of the movie would have to be the eminently amusing clarence williams the iii as the arrogant , leering \" king of jazz \" who challenges 1900 to the aforementioned piano duel . \\nthe legend of 1900 was made by giuseppe tornatore , whose 1988 cinema paradiso is considered a masterpiece by many . \\nthis effort is utterly limp and lifeless . \\nat once ridiculous , boring , narrow-sighted and pointless , this is one movie that should be -- and will be -- quickly forgotten . \\n', b'when _star wars_ came out some twenty years ago , the image of traveling throughout the stars has become a commonplace image . \\nwhen the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars , we see constellations , meteor showers , and cool space-ships . \\nwhen han solo goes light speed , the stars change to bright lines , going towards the viewer in lines that converge at an invisible point . \\ncool . \\n_october sky_ offers a much simpler image--that of a single white dot , traveling horizontally across the night sky . \\nwas it really only forty years ago , when sputnik was launched , and that before then , no satellites ever existed ? \\nhave we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see a then-technological achievement , even though it was from the russians ? \\nit sounds hokey , but when that scene occurs near the beginning of _october sky_ , i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam , played by jake gyllenhaal . \\ndetermined to make a dent in the space race , he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket that could fly like the best of them . \\nit is films like this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket . \\nwhen lovely teacher miss riley ( played by laura dern ) , suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair , we know exactly who is going to win . \\nbut the joy in a film like this is in the little details . \\nfor example , homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class . \\nif he has any strengths whatsoever , it is an undeterring vision , and a good organizer . \\nit means that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school , who knows more about rocket science than he does . \\nit means that if his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property ( that is , the entire coal-mining town ) , he must walk eight miles one way , just to set up the rockets , which will fail , fail , fail , and fail again . \\nhomer+s dad is played by chris cooper , a favorite actor of mine since _lone star_ . \\nhere he plays the antithesis of the character he played in _matewan_ : instead of organizing union rallies , he is the head of the coal-miners , who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions . \\nthis is will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year : note how multi-dimensional his character is . \\nhe is his son+s last nemesis , as one who most likely interferes with his son+s dreams . \\nbut he truly loves his son , and wants to see him succeed the only way he knows how . \\nthrough coal-mining . \\nbecause of his character , we can see how far we+ve come . \\nthe revolution of modern technology has allowed for us to see society advanced at a rate far faster than any generation before us . \\nwe don+t understand that there were the generations from the industrial revolution who knew of no other way to raise a family . \\nthe paradigm was shifting under the father+s feet , and he knew of no other life . \\nso _october sky_ , far from being merely a feel-good inspirational film , offers much food for thought . \\nand this is the best type of inspirational film ; the one that you take something with you . \\nbtw , the final image of the film is just as simple , is as strong a contrast as the aforementioned horizontal-moving white dot against the night-sky background . \\nanother commonplace image , to be sure , but it must have been breathtaking forty years ago . \\n', b\"warning : contains what the matrix is . \\nrated r for

waiting for something to happen . \\nnow wait wait , i know most of you loved it , and i'm not saying i didn't like it . \\nwhat i'm saying is the first half was extremely slow . \\nnow seeing the trailer it makes you think the whole entire movie is one big special effects show . \\ndon't be fooled , this movie has a big story . \\nand big chunks of talky moments . \\nbut i will admit the special effects and the acting were above par , deserving the rating above . \\nok now to the story . \\nwell this may take a while . \\nok first of all , our world we live in now , is not the real world , actually we live inside a computer generated world known as the matrix . \\na man played by keanu reeves is about to find that out , when is kidnapped and almost coaxed to go into the real world . \\nhe does so , and finds out that he can do anything , be anything he wants to be . \\nbut he has to fight a 'matrix skipping' bad guy , who wants to send him back to his own world or destroy him . \\nlaurence fishburne , his guide of sorts plays his character well as does keanu reeves . \\nbut i sat in the theatre for over and hour wondering where all the special effects were . \\nyeah there were some in the first half but not enough . \\nthe trailer for this movie was really decieving making people think that this was a special effects laden movie . \\nnow for the second half , it is explosive , and saves the movie . \\nsome of the special effects and fighting were breathtaking . \\nthe sound , the music , and all the effects were effective , and the last hour kept us entertained . \\nbut with a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes , this movie is at least 40 minutes too long . \\none would have wished for a better 'matrix' , but i do have to say , i did like it and i was entertained . \\n\", b'having not seen , \" who framed roger rabbit \" in over 10 years , and not remembering much besides that i liked it then , i decided to rent it recently . \\nwatching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is . \\naside from the fact that it\\'s a milestone in animation in movies ( it\\'s the first film to combine real actors and cartoon characters , have them interact , and make it convincingly real ) and a great entertainment it\\'s also quite an effective comedy/mystery . \\nwhile the plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original , especially baby herman , and watching them together is a lot of fun . \\nthe story begins in hollywood in 1947 . \\ncartoon star roger rabbit is blowing takes and having trouble keeping his mind on work , so hard-boiled private detective eddie valiant ( bob hoskins ) is called in by studio head r . k . \\nmaroon ( alan tilvern ) to try to help get roger\\'s mind back on work . \\nmaroon thinks that roger\\'s wife , jessica\\'s , possible unfaithfulness to him might be the cause of distraction and tells eddie to get some photos of her in the act before it costs him any more money in reshoots . \\nvaliant takes some photos of jessica playing , `patty cake\\' with marvin acme ( stubby kaye ) , the owner of toontown ( where all of the cartoon characters live ) and takes them to maroon . \\nupon seeing them , roger is emotionally destroyed and soon after acme is found dead and roger rabbit is the prime suspect . \\nthe rest of the movie follows valiant and roger as they run around town ( and eventually toontown ) trying to clear roger\\'s good name . \\nalong the way they meet judge doom ( christopher lloyd ) a judge-jury-and executioner type who\\'s out to get roger and has discovered the one and only way to kill a `toon . \\' \\n`who framed roger rabbit\\' won 4 academy awards including a special achievement award for richard williams for animation direction and creation of the cartoon characters ( williams and his teams went through the film frame by frame and hand drew the cartoon characters in ) . \\ndirector robert zemekis must be given an equal amount of praise for overseeing the entire production , which included hundreds of animators . \\nalso bob hoskins\\' performance should be credited . \\nhe , in addition to the rest of the human cast , finds the right note to play in all of the scenes with his cartoon co-stars . \\naccording to the internet movie database , hoskins studied his young daughter to learn how to act with imaginary characters and i guess his hard work paid off . \\n`who framed roger rabbit\\' is a rare film . \\none that not only presented a great challenge to the filmmakers but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family ( although some very young viewers may be a little scared by judge doom ) . \\ndo yourself a favor and rent it , `p-p-p-p-please . \" \\n', b' \" spawn \" features good guys , bad guys , lots of fighting , bloody violence , a leather-clad machine gun chick , gooey , self-healing bullet holes , scatological humor and a man-eating monster . \\nit not only appears to have been tailor made for a swarm of 12- and 13-year-old boys , it appears to have been made by them . \\nin a classic example of telling and not showing , \" spawn \" opens with a truckload of mumbo jumbo about forces of darkness , forces of light and how \" men are the ones who create evil on earth . \" \\nso much for a message . \\nthe movie then lurches forward into the plight of al simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government assassin/operative who is murdered by diabolical boss jason wynn ( martin sheen , who plays all of his scenes like an oscar clip ) while on a top secret mission in a north korean biological weapons plant . \\nsimmons goes to hell and back , after making a deal with satan himself -- if he agrees to command the devil\\'s army to overtake the world , he\\'ll be allowed to return to earth to see his wife wanda ( underused theresa randle ) and little girl cyan ( sydni beaudoin ) . \\nof course , seeing as how five years has passed , wanda has fallen for -- and married -- simmons\\' partner ( d . b . \\nsweeney ) . \\nhis , uh , shoulder to cry on comes in the form of clown ( john leguizamo ) , a disgustingly disproportioned minion of satan\\'s . \\nclown manipulates simmons , now in superhuman spawn form , into a stand off with wynn . \\nwynn , who thinks he is in league with the double-dealing clown , recognizes spawn as a threat and undergoes an operation where a bomb is placed on his heart -- when it stops beating , major cities around the world will detonate , causing the leak of a disease that \" makes the ebola virus look like a skin rash . \" \\nphew . got all that ? \\nit would be easy to dismiss \" spawn \" as just another one of those heavy-on-fx , short-on-substance action pics , but it doesn\\'t even work on that level . \\nthe computer-generated sequences are often and plenty , and the problem is that they look too computer-generated . \\nthe several scenes set in hell present a devil that looks and acts like a video game graphic -- with the movie\\'s healthy budget you\\'d think they could have afforded to make his mouth move when he talks . \\nother elements of the movie are so-so ; spawn\\'s enormous red , flowing cape is a wonderful sight , but it\\'s too obvious when he\\'s being played by a costumed actor or an image . \\nin movies like \" contact , \" the special effects serve the story . \\nin \" spawn , \" they are the story . \\nand spawn himself isn\\'t even an interesting character . \\nthe film\\'s reliance on razzle-dazzle would be acceptable if we were given somebody to root for , but both simmons and his funky alter-ego are completely underdeveloped . \\nwhat we need is a batman , a luke skywalker . \\neven watching the adventures of kleenex man would be more interesting than spawn . \\npoor leguizamo . \\nhe starred in february\\'s \" the pest , \" a movie that i still think is the year\\'s worst so far , although this one does give it a run for its money . \\nas clown , he overacts to the extreme , never missing an opportunity for a poor-taste punchline . \\nleguizamo farts green mist , munches a pizza slice covered with maggots and even dons a mini-skirt and performs a cheerleader routine , all before turning into a giant grey demon . \\nthe guy was brilliant in \" to wong foo , thanks for everything ! \\njulie newmar . \" \\nwhat is he doing wasting his talent in this and \" the pest \" ? \\ni\\'m one of the few people that liked \" batman & robin , \" this summer\\'s other big-budget comic book film . \\nyet after catching this movie and making the inevitable comparison , i can only hope people will change their minds and think of \" batman \" as the superior adaptation . \\nthere\\'s a compelling story somewhere in \" spawn \" -- including strong religious overtones and the debut of the first african-american superhero ever -- but it\\'s just not found anywhere near here . \\nas it is , \" spawn \" is just awful -- it stinks worse than a dead trout . \\n', b\"`we run tings . \\ntings don't run we . ' \\n-sound advice from capone ( paul campbell ) to his squaddie ( or partner ) , floyd ( winston bell ) . \\njamaican film , shot entirely on video , featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo-styled brotherhood morals ( and a little gunplay ) . \\ncapone , a tough as nails super cop , gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home ( while he was with his lady ) and killed his partner in front of him . \\nwhen he arrives , he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse , thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie ( jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw ) , so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook ) . \\ncapone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and , much to his disappointment , also finds out his childhood friend ratty ( mark danvers ) has been helping him . \\ntorn between doing his job and protecting his best friend , capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again . \\ndirected deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne ( assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct ) , one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while . \\nshots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films , although the action isn't as hyperkinetic as most of woo's films are . \\nthe action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though , and eventually begin to take on a life of their own ( beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after ) . \\nthe make-up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well , with flawless squib work on display from the effects team . \\nthe cast is superb and listening to their dialogue , spoken with thick jamaican accents ( half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang ) , just adds to the interest . \\npaul campbell , as the `loose cannon' capone , essays his role perfectly , displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times . \\nmark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty , the part-time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together . \\nunfortunately , carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective ( largely because his underlings seem to run all over him ) , but then again , that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed . \\nthe music in the film is composed of all reggae songs , and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists , sly and robbie ( who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones , maxi priest , bob dylan , james brown , grace jones , herbie hancock , bootsy collins , and carly simon among others ) . \\nthe end credit song , `we run tings' , by the group red dragon , is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review . \\noddly enough , desmond ballentine ( who plays the character deportee ) is well known as a pioneer in the realm of `gangsta' reggae as the performer ninjaman , and he doesn't contribute a single song to the film ( that i could see ) , which is virtually unheard of here in the us . \\nat the time of this writing , third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us , coming off of a six-month box-office breaking run in jamaica , where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time ( bringing in $21 million in jamaica , which is roughly $500 , 000 us ) . \\npalm pictures ( the company that released the offbeat , but entertaining six-string samurai ) is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market , i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters . \\nchris blackwell , founder of palm pictures , was also involved in the production of another jamaican box-office smash in 1981 entitled countryman , so i'd say he has a pretty good track record . \\noverall , third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo , ringo lam , tsui hark , and many other action films by directors from hong kong . \\nif action films are your thing and you don't mind intermittent subtitles , then you can't go wrong with this film . \\nthe performances and the story are solid ( if only a little cliched ) and the action is tight . \\ni'm not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like , but apparently third world cop's honors are well deserved . \\n\", b\"one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction . \\nthe purpose of star trek is to provide flashy , innocent fun . \\nsometimes the stories are compelling . \\nsometimes they're not . \\nbut , with the exception of the first film in the series ( which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces ) , i've never been bored by any of the enterprise's numerous missions . \\nstar trek : insurrection is no exception . \\nthe film has gotten some negative reviews ( a friend of mine actually thinks it's the worst in the series ) , but i'm not really sure why . \\nit's an exciting , often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film . \\nsome say it's a bit too light , and more of a long episode than a film . \\nothers say the special effects are cheesy and that it's boring . \\ni simply enjoyed the film . \\ninsurrection , which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast , introduces us to a race of people called the ba'ku ; the ba'ku are very old ( most of them are about three hundred years old ) , but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet . \\nof course , these peaceful people can't horde this fountain of youth all for themselves ? leave it up to their archenemies , the son'a , led by ru'afo ( f . \\nmurray abraham ) , to mess everything up . \\nthe son'a , who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable , strike a deal with the federation to move the ba'ku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying . \\nthat's when captain picard ( patrick stewart ) steps in : he realizes that moving the ba'ku would kill them ( it also helps that he falls in love with a ba'ku woman ( donna murphy ) ) . \\nso , with his trusty crew , picard defies the federation to keep the ba'ku in their natural habitat . \\nwhen dealing with a series with as much history as this , it's not entirely necessary to re-introduce your characters with each episode . \\nthis is why i believe non-fans have a hard time getting into star trek ; in order to enjoy it , one has to understand how to approach it . \\ninsurrection , however , does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters . \\nstewart is bold as always , a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together . \\njonathan frakes , who also directed , is funny as commander riker ; a subplot with data ( brent spiner ) discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting ; and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain , overacting like crazy . \\nfrakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact ; insurrection is an exciting film , with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action . \\nthis is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation , and the result is very pleasing to the eye : particularly in the climactic scenes , in which the son'a employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the ba'ku planet , the special effects have a clean , impressively sharp look . \\nif i have any complaint about the film , it's that it tries to take a moral stance when it's not very appropriate to do so . \\ni don't think it's that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move 600 ba'ku in order to save the lives of thousands . \\nbetter yet , why couldn't they have co-existed ? \\ninsurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience . \\nwith it's inherent camp factor , the star trek series doesn't seem well-equipped to deal with issues like this . \\ni prefer to just enjoy the spectacle . \\n\", b'for those of us who weren\\'t yet born when the 1960\\'s rock \\'n\\' rolled around , monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies . \\nfrom otis redding to jimi hendrix , janis joplin to the mamas and the papas , and jefferson airplane to the who , this documentary is jam-packed with contagious energy . \\nbut i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending , which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves . \\nshot in 1969 at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock , the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time . \\nsure , some have painted their faces and smoke joints , but d . a . \\npennebaker ( the war room , moon over broadway ) surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum of the audience . \\nno matter who is watching , it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul . \\nthe excitement starts before the music even begins . \\na young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer , she replies that she feels lucky to do so . \\nthere are moments of organized craziness as john phillips , leader of the mamas and the papas and one of the concert organizers , tries to get in touch with dionne warwick . \\nand when one band is tuning up , a member remarks , \" finally , a decent sound system ! \" \\nyou can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isn\\'t about vanity , it\\'s about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it , a two-way street . \\nthis interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience . \\nit\\'s impossible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball and chain . \\nand while the lyrics to \" wild thing \" may not be all that complicated , watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love . \\neven if you don\\'t recognize every band you see on stage , you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats . \\nthe only drawback to the film is the ending , which unfortunately i must reveal . \\nall the other bands , big names then and still today , got approximately 7 to 10 minutes of screen time . \\nin contrast , the last band on camera , a wholly forgettable one , gets an entire 18 minutes of screen time . \\nfor a film that\\'s only 78 minutes long , that\\'s too large of a chunk , especially when previous acts are much more stimulating . \\nall in all , monterey pop is a precious , rare look at a time period that still holds sway over us . \\nthe variety of music , as well as the beautifully shot performances , are easy to become immersed in . \\nif there was ever any question as to why most of these bands were so popular , this is quickly dispelled . \\nit\\'s almost depressing to think that music this moving doesn\\'t get made much anymore . \\ninstead we\\'re stuck with * nsync , the backstreet boys , and jennifer lopez , all of whom should have stuck with modeling . \\n', b'one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jean-luc godard film . \\nafter all , he was a founding member of the highly influential french new wave . \\nhe is also an esteemed film critic , lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing . \\nhowever , his latest creation , in praise of love , is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year . \\nthe abstract concept on which the film is based had merit , to dissect love into the following four categories : meeting , physical passion , quarrels , and reconciliation . \\nthese four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples : young , adult , and elderly . \\nit is edgar\\'s ( bruno putzulu ) self-appointed task to capture these moments after a recent breakup , to define a central idea : \" it\\'s only when things are over that they make sense . \" \\nwhether this project will end up a play , film , or opera remains undecided . \\nthe thesis is simple enough that , if played right , it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone . \\ninstead what ensues is an hour and a half of repetitive vignettes , the next scene no more engaging than the last . \\nonly once does any character utter something worthwhile , but by the time it happens you\\'re so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it . \\nbut don\\'t fret , it will surface again . \\nyou could easily sleep through whole sections of the film ( as some fellow critics did ) and wake up in a scene exactly like the one you nodded off in , not having missed anything worthwhile . \\nbut you hold hope for some time . \\nthe background music keeps you in a state of urgency , and even suspense , for the first few conversations . \\nit\\'s only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope . \\nand with speeches like , \" i am thinking of something , but i can only think of that something when i am thinking of something else , \" how can you expect to hold anyone\\'s interest ? \\nto godard\\'s credit , he certainly knows how to frame a scene . \\nthe black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful . \\nwatching edgar read while walking along a train track on a mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him . \\nand if this film had anything poignant to say , you would have , which makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities . \\nthe environments , be it city or country , are impeccably captured in crisp detail , but the script never complements them . \\nunfortunately , godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to black numerous times within any given scene . \\nsometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings , but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words . \\nthe second half is composed of nauseating hyper-color that often blurs the image . \\nyou suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners . \\nthe only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies . \\nsteven spielberg is picked on in particular . \\nwhile i\\'ll grant that this does happen , and i tend to shy away from watching such garbage , it\\'s still a pointless focus for a film that purports to articulate the specific qualities of couplehood . \\nit just goes to show , an intelligent person isn\\'t necessarily an admirable storyteller . \\nthe days of breathless are no more . \\n', b' \" lake placid \" marks yet another entry in the series of \" predator pics \" that were a screen staple in the late 1970s ( post- \" jaws \" ) and were revived recently by the godawful \" anaconda . \" \\n \" placid \" claims to be a \" horror/comedy \" -it\\'s directed by the same guy who did \" house \" -but its attempts at humor are actually less funny than deadpan seriousness of \" anaconda . \" \\npaleontologist kelly scott ( bridget fonda ) is sent up to maine to examine a tooth removed from a body that had been bitten in half on the lake . \\ndiscovering that the tooth belongs to a crocodile ( which shouldn\\'t even be in this hemisphere ) , kelly goes croc-hunting with game warden jack wells ( bill pullman ) and sheriff hank keough ( brendan gleeson ) . \\nthey\\'re joined by an unwelcome guest , hector cyr ( oliver platt ) , a scholar who worships crocs and searches all over the world for them . \\nalong the way , the merry band meets mrs . delores bickerman ( betty white ) , a weird old lady who lives out on the lake . \\nyou know what to expect from this movie : lots of shots where the camera is the eyes of the predator ( croc cam ) swimming toward someone\\'s dangling legs while \" jaws \" -like music plays , one character ( hector ) who\\'s obsessed with the croc and stupidly endangers the rest , another character who insists that the predator can\\'t possibly exist . \\nunlike its slippery cousin \" anaconda , \" \" lake placid \" wants to present its formulaic plot tongue-in-cheek , which is self-defeating . \\nthe result is neither scary nor funny ; it\\'s just tedious . \\nwhile director steve miner has several horror films on his resume ( including two installments of \" friday the 13th \" and \" halloween h20 \" ) , screenwriter david kelley ( best known as the creator of tv series like \" ally mcbeal \" and \" chicago hope \" ) doesn\\'t seem to have the stomach for a chomp \\'em up flick . \\nthe body count is surprisingly low and doesn\\'t include any of the major characters , and most annoyingly kelly and hector insist that they capture the crocodile alive rather than killing it . \\n ( \" lake placid \" manages to have it both ways-i\\'ll let you discover how for yourself ) . \\nthe croc itself is mostly computer-generated , of course . \\nlike the snake in \" anaconda , \" the thirty-foot monster crocodile doesn\\'t seem real ; it moves too quickly and in ways that seem unnatural . \\n \" lake placid \" also offers little explanation for why a giant crocodile is in maine . \\nthere is a lot of semi-mystical mumbo jumbo about how \" we really don\\'t know much about crocodiles . \" \\nthey would have been better off going with something like the urban myth about alligators in the sewers . \\na movie like this doesn\\'t have to offer much of an explanation ( radioactive mutant ? \\ncreature from outer space ? ) , but it does have to give the audience something to hang their disbelief on . \\npullman and fonda seem to be plodding through the movie on auto-pilot . \\nmost of the time , they\\'re probably thinking about killing their agents or wondering if making this movie marks the end of their careers . \\nplatt and white , on the other hand , seem to be giving their best efforts , and they manage to squeeze a few chuckles out of this sorry script . \\n', b'linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction , and her being cast as dogma\\'s lead is nothing short of inexplicable . \\nshe\\'s still in fine form as bethany , an abortion clinic worker who\\'s lost her faith . \\none night , a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethany\\'s bedroom . \\nhe is metatron ( alan rickman ) , the voice of god , and he needs her help : she must stop two fallen angels from entering a new jersey church-the fate of the universe depends on it . \\ngod would do it him/herself , but he/she is . . . missing , having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again . \\nbethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the \" prophets \" jay ( jason mewes ) and silent bob ( kevin smith , doing double-duty ) , the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smith\\'s films thus far . \\nat some point , rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus , the undocumented ( and very black ) \" thirteenth apostle \" , and offers his assistance , as does divine stripper serendipity ( salma hayek ) . \\nit\\'s a wild ride . \\nthey\\'re in pursuit of loki and bartleby ( damon and affleck , respectively-this is probably the sharpest either has ever been ) , who were banished from heaven to wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic loophole that will enable their return . \\nloki decides to wreak havoc along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates . \\nat one point , he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words and bullets . \\nit\\'s a nasty , guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks , \" how corrupt are you ? \" . \\nwings of desire this ain\\'t . \\nsince debuting with clerks , smith has grown as a director , particularly in terms of working with actors . \\n ( chris rock is this film\\'s only weak link-between jokes , he\\'s wooden . ) \\nhis no-frills visual style hasn\\'t changed much over the years , though ( dogma\\'s widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations ) , nor has his writing-his characters still sit around delivering one caustic , hilarious speech after another . \\ndogma chips away at big religious issues-namely , the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefs-eloquently and articulately , but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition . \\nas well , the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever . \\nany movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum ( hurlyburly , anyone ? ) , and eventually dogma\\'s pacing goes slack . \\na long diatribe from bartleby late in the game , in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings , comes at a point when we\\'ve heard enough . \\nbecause his change of heart ( bartleby is initially the good cop to loki\\'s bad ) drives the climax , said rant is given a great deal of screen time . \\nsure , affleck deserved a big moment ( damon steals their scenes together prior ) , but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated . \\nlike tarantino , smith was a video-age sponge who became a sample-mad indie filmmaker . \\ndogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies , including indiana jones and the last crusade , with silent bob doing his best harrison ford , and weird science-a shit demon attacks our heroes ! \\nsmith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour : his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical ( a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan \" catholicism wow ! \" ) and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished . \\ni bust ( ed ? ) a gut on several occasions . \\nproceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever . \\nit\\'s a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease , for to read it , one actually has to see dogma . \\nthe prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christ\\'s , martin scorsese\\'s 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis\\' controversial novel , in that it is not directly linked to the picture\\'s content but to rumours and heresy . \\nthere\\'s a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime , just so they could know for certain what they were rallying against . \\n ( not one of them had watched it . ) \\nevery single person refused . \\nsmith and scorsese have a lot in common , and so do the two films in question , because both smith\\'s bethany and scorsese\\'s jesus are hollow shells without their faith . \\nin fact , dogma\\'s denouement ( which follows a thrilling showdown that\\'s worth the wait ) is a catholic love-in , a veritable recruitment poster . \\n ( i felt sentimental about a religion i don\\'t belong to . \\nnow that\\'s powerful filmmaking . ) smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god , and that spirituality shines through . \\nit\\'s enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins . \\nmy religion is movies . \\nwhen the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine , in a roundabout way they\\'re attacking what i live for : freedom of expression through celluloid . \\ni therefore feel that , although i\\'m no bible-thumper , i\\'m at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue and his followers . \\n', b'all through its production and into the early days of its initial , aborted pre-release publicity , hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood . \\nultimately , however , paramount pictures , nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996\\'s other , underperforming disaster films ( dante\\'s peak , volcano ) , changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year . \\nbut , to paraphrase the bard , swill , by any other name , would smell as rank . \\nno number of name changes can help this picture . \\nit\\'s not just about a disaster , it is a disaster . \\nhard rain is the case of a movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute . \\nthe best shot occurs during the opening credits , as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg , indiana as the water level slowly rises . \\nthe community , protected by an overworked dam , is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud-choked skies . \\nfrom that moment on , it\\'s all downhill . \\nwhatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point . \\nit takes forever to get to the end credits -- this is one of the longest-seeming 95-minute motion pictures i have recently endured . \\nbasically , hard rain is one extended , dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot-outs . \\nthere\\'s a lot of water , broken glass , gunfire , and explosions . \\nit\\'s all very routine and uninteresting because there aren\\'t any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense . \\nthe film\\'s conclusion is so preposterous that it\\'s almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around . \\naction films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards a conclusion . \\ngraham yost , the writer of both speed and hard rain , surely understands that principle . \\nunfortunately , neither he , nor cinematographer-turned-director mikael salomon ( a far off place ) , applies it . \\nthe action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition . \\nwe see the same kinds of things -- speedboat chases , flood damage , shoot-outs , etc . -- over and over again . \\nthe movie constantly recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad the running time out to an acceptable movie length . \\nthe storyline gives us a number of paper-thin characters in contrived circumstances . \\nthere\\'s tom ( christian slater ) , the one- dimensional action hero who works as a security guard driving an armored car full of cash . \\nhe and his partner , charlie ( edward asner , tv\\'s \" lou grant \" ) , get stuck on a street that\\'s rapidly turning into a river . \\na group of men , led by jimmy ( morgan freeman ) , arrive on the scene not as rescuers but as robbers . \\nafter charlie is killed in a shoot-out , tom hides the money , then runs . \\nas he swims and boats his way through huntingburg\\'s roads , he encounters some of the locals : karen ( minnie driver ) , a would-be love interest ; a bickering old couple ( richard dysart and betty white ) , who are on hand to provide comic relief ; and the easily-corrupted sheriff ( randy quaid ) , whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives . \\nthere isn\\'t any real acting in this film . \\nchristian slater utters a few lame one-liners and does a lot of mugging for the camera . \\ntom is easily one of the most lifeless characters the actor has brought to the screen . \\nrandy quaid sneers a lot , and is totally unconvincing . \\nmorgan freeman and minnie driver both attempt to give legitimate performances , but they are defeated by the script . \\nfreeman , one of the best cinematic thespians working today , looks suitably embarrassed to be here , but i suppose everyone needs a good paycheck from time-to-time . \\nfollowing in the wake of twister , this is yet another natural disaster movie that doesn\\'t trust nature\\'s fury as the chief engine of conflict . \\nas a result , we are saddled with an idiotic good guys/bad guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale could have had . \\ntitanic proved that there can be a wealth of drama in a movie where everything goes under water . \\nhard rain successfully demonstrates that the opposite is equally possible . \\nthus far this year , hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem by fire ( firestorm ) and water ( hard rain ) . \\nfortunately , there are only two elements left . \\n', b'the classic story & the production which ruined it \\nmarking the centennial anniversary of the 1896 h . g . wells classic , new line cinema , armed with a stellar cast and expert make-up effects man stan winston ( alien , predator , terminator etc ) churns out yet another hollywood film based on the classic novel . \\nof course , the production is no doubt much more superior compared to the earlier 2 movies , one of which was made back in the 1933 and the other in the 1977 , under the title the island of lost souls ( sounds like a much better title . . ) . \\nthe story begins with edward douglas ( thewlis ) , a un representative sent to oversee a peace treaty somewhere in the south pacific , who is saved from the brink of death by montgomery ( kilmer ) after his plane crashes into the sea . \\ndouglas soon learns that montgomery is working for dr . moreau , who incidently , owns the island and also a reputable geneticist who has been awarded the nobel prize . \\nhis host\\'s reluctance to allow him to freely move around the island becomes clear when he stumbled into moreau\\'s lab , when a monstrous birth was in progress . \\neven worse , the other workers in the lab are not exactly normal \" people . \" \\ndouglas stumbles across yet another shocking discovery when he is led to the beast-people community , which considers dr . moreau their maker . \\nusing shock-therapy and the law , dr . moreau has long been able to keep his beast-people civilised to some extent but there are a few animal-men who are just too savage to be controlled . \\nthe island of dr . \\nmoreau questions the ability of men playing god . \\ndr . moreau is a man obsessed with creating a race of beings which is free from hate and violence . . . but the savage within every beast is not something one can suppress for long . \\nmoreau has no doubt a very interesting premise within its grasp . \\neven so , the production has failed to make the most out of it . \\nthere are too many characters to put your attention to and the worst thing is , the characters are not \" prioritized \" so when the audience is led to believe that a particular character is important , before they know it , he or she or it perishes . . . . rather \\nungloriously at times too . \\nperhaps there is some redemption in the development of the beast people , especially aissa ( balk ) , the most human of moreau\\'s creations . \\nthe two very important characters , montgomery and dr . moreau himself receive no development at all and it is in this area that the script fails miserably . \\nmore screen time could have been used for character interaction and development . \\ni really would have liked it better if , say , they delved more into dr . moreau\\'s obsession , montgomery\\'s purpose in the story and justification to as why the beast-people had to rebel . \\nmaybe the nature of the screenplay , which incidently , does not incorporate much action sequences in the film , forced the filmmakers to \" cut a long story short \" and make it more of an action film than anything else ( it\\'s still summer , and movies have to be \" marketable \" ) . \\nthe special effects too , are really nothing for anyone to shout about . \\nat most , i would say the beast-men looked just a bit more realistic than those apes in planet of the apes . \\nthis h . g . wells classic really has potential to be a good film . \\nunfortunately , after 2 adaptations , they still could not decide on how and what to focus their attention on to really bring out that important message which makes up the entire essence of the story . \\nas a third outing , the island of dr . moreau \\naccomplishes little and is nothing more than an inferior version of `the planet of the apes\\' . \\nthe flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . \\n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \\n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \\n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \\n * * * * * perfection . \\nsee it twice . \\n', b'the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do . \\nlives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment\\'s notice . \\nthe negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower . \\nmost of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants . \\nit takes a pretty smart person to do that . \\nbut what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ? \\nwhat if he\\'s also able to think on his feet ? \\nin fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ? \\nit is this circumstance which forms the basis for f . gary gray\\'s the negotiator . \\nin this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l . jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force . \\nwhen his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman\\'s home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder . \\nfaced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain\\'s office . \\ni don\\'t quite remember if the captain actually said , \" i hate to do this , but . . . \" , \\nalthough it wouldn\\'t surprise me if he did . \\nluckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above . \\nafter being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j . t . \\nwalsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed . \\nalthough roman\\'s actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue . \\njackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman . \\nthe actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats . \\nthe script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence . \\nhow can we believe he\\'s going to shoot a hostage , no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ? \\nunfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it\\'s would-be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson\\'s acting ability . \\nalmost every time he\\'s in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back . \\nwhen spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course . \\nhis is an interesting character . \\nmade out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation . \\n \" i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can\\'t talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , \" he says . \\nwhen he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be . \\nsoon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail . \\nthis complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor . \\nas the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely . \\ngray really lucked out with this cast . \\ndavid morse as commander beck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey . \\nthe only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d . a . \\nin l . a . confidential , and spencer played a police detective in cop land . \\nwith the level of acting , however , this can be forgiven . \\nalso in the supporting cast , paul giamatti as rudy , one of the hostages , is notable for the comic relief he provides . \\nhis character is initially so slimy , and giamatti himself just looks so shifty , that you expect to laugh before he even says anything . \\nfortunately , this doesn\\'t distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film , but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout . \\nj . t . walsh , as the suspicious internal affairs inspector , clocks in with one of his final performances . \\nsadly , the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year , and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film . \\nwalsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam , backdraft , and nixon . \\nfor one of his best performances , check out sling blade , in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton . \\nwhen jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march , walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success ( the actors performed together in a few good men ) . \\nthe negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh , and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role , it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing . \\nin the end , the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it\\'s reality . \\nwe\\'re served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best . \\nas an audience , we\\'re also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie , and we\\'d like to see if one will dominate the film . \\nboth provide some pretty good entertainment . \\n', b'one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy\\'s wedding . \\nand she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it . \\nher reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald , who hasn\\'t made a worthwhile film since 1986 . \\nbut the fact is , betsy\\'s wedding is also an alan alda film . \\nand while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years , alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects , including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life . \\nwritten and directed by alda , betsy\\'s wedding is a vibrant slice-of-life , mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor . \\nalda\\'s comic elixir is smooth and refreshing--and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare . \\nas bride and groom , molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film , but they are by far the least interesting . \\nwalsh is a nonentity , with all the screen presence of a door knob . \\nringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain . \\nshe looks hideous with her short-cropped orange hair , red lip-stick and grotesque outfits . \\nshe\\'s supposed to be a dress designer , but she looks more like a clown . \\nand to make matters worse , ringwald\\'s performance matches her appearance . \\nthankfully , alda keeps ringwald\\'s screen time to a minimum ; he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters . \\nthe wedding is just a device to bring together the bride\\'s working-class , italian family and the groom\\'s rich , gentile family . \\nringwald\\'s folks are homey and down-to-earth , with alda as her free-spirited father , madeline kahn as her practical mother , and ally sheedy as her lonely sister . \\nwalsh\\'s clan , on the other hand , is prim , proper and ostentatious . \\nwhen the two families meet and mingle , the movie becomes a story of culture clash , or as one character puts it , \" money versus values . \" \\nally sheedy , in a wonderfully understated performance , is one of the film\\'s most pleasant surprises . \\nsheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body . \\nit\\'s anthony lapaglia , however , who seizes the spotlight . \\nlapaglia plays stevie dee , a suave , overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old-fashioned chivalry . \\nlapaglia\\'s sincere but dim-witted character is a riot . \\nand what\\'s uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro , with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure . \\nlapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting , and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role-model and partly a rip-off . \\ni don\\'t know whether to say a star is born or a star is re-born , but i do know that lapaglia\\'s over-the-top performance should not be missed . \\nthe scrumptious comic acting , however , extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia . \\njoe pesci , in particular , sinks his teeth into his role as alda\\'s unscrupulous brother-in-law , a slum lord with mob ties , who is cheating on his wife ( catherine o\\'hara ) . \\nalda , faced with challenge of both directing and acting , somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride\\'s financially-strapped father , a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet . \\nthe film adopts alda\\'s psychological point of view as he tries to one : plan the wedding , and two : pay for it . \\nas a filmmaker , alda\\'s style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful . \\nand while he doesn\\'t have the comic genius of a woody allen , alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy . \\n', b\"and now the high-flying hong kong style of filmmaking has made its way down to the classics , and it isn't pretty . \\nthis time out the nod to asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer , a version of dumas's the three musketeers . \\nby bringing in popular asian actor/stunt coordinator xing xing xiong -- whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez -- our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting . \\nthe end result is a tepid and dull action/adventure rip-off that stinks of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu . \\nthe story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay . \\nd'artagnan ( justin chambers ) is the vengeful son of a slain musketeer . \\nhe travels to paris to join the royal musketeers and find the man that killed his parents . \\nin paris , he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu ( stephen rea ) , who is trying to overthrow the king , and richelieu's man-in-black associate febre ( tim roth ) , the killer of his folks . \\nhe finds the musketeers in paris disbanded and drunk , so he rounds up aramis ( nick moran ) , athos ( jan gregor kremp ) and porthos ( steven spiers ) to free the musketeer's wrongfully imprisoned leader treville from the king's prison . \\nd'artagnan and his new frisky love interest/chambermaid francesca ( mena suvari ) play footsy and coo at each other as the cardinal hunts down the musketeers until finally the queen ( catherine deneuve ) ends up being captured by the menancing febre , forcing the musketeers to regroup , with d'artagnan leading the charge , and save the day . \\ndirector peter hyams ( end of days ) obviously wanted to blend eastern and western filmmaking styles , but here it's a disaster . \\none problem is that , in reality , most eastern films have taken their lead from western ones . \\njet li's high risk is a rip-off of die hard -- not the other way around . \\nironically , there is awfully little swordplay or action in the film at all -- maybe ten minutes of swashbuckling spread over five scenes . \\nmost asian action films carry the bulk of their production with 20- to 30-minute action sequences , because they know the scenes have to carry the picture . \\nthe musketeer instead weighs itself down with a predictable and monotonous screenplay by gene quintano ( sudden death ) , horrible acting by stephen rea and tim roth , and the prosaic attempt of justin chambers ( the wedding planner ) to deliver his mousy self as a leader . \\nchambers' d'artangnan isn't a musketeer -- he's a mouseketeer ! \\nand hyam's use of candles and torches to light the grime and filth of 17th century paris are well-noted , but that's the only standout in an overall flat production . \\n\", b'that thing you do ! \\n ( r ) tom hanks\\'s screenwriting and directorial debut , that thing you do ! , has all the qualities you would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment : fun , lively , and oh-so-nice . \\nit is the latter quality , however , that becomes a hindrance , for this \\'60s nostalgia trifle is so nice and sweet that it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast . \\nthat thing focuses on the wonders , a teen rock band from erie , pennsylvania that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in 1964 when they score a major dance hit called , of course , \" that thing you do ! \" \\nthe group\\'s members are , naturally a diverse group : there\\'s brooding lead singer and songwriter jimmy ( johnathon schaech ) ; girl-crazy lenny ( steve zahn ) , the lead guitarist ; a goofy , geeky type known only as the bass player ( ethan embry ) ; and the film\\'s center , guy ( tom everett scott ) , the drummer who has aspirations in jazz . \\nalong for the wonders\\' ride to success is jimmy\\'s perpetually neglected galpal , faye ( liv tyler ) . \\nhanks proves to be a capable writer-director , deftly recreating the innocent spirit of 1964 , which hanks calls \" the last innocent year . \" \\nthe spirit is not only reflected in the period clothes and settings but also in the music , which , like the other recent period music film , grace of my heart , was expressly written for the film ; hanks himself had a hand in writing four of the tunes--but not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger , which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after the end credits have rolled ( it\\'s still playing in my mind as i write this ) . \\nit should come as no surprise that hanks the director works well with the actors , eliciting charming , likable work from the entire cast , most notably hanks lookalike scott and tyler , who is remarkable in delivering the film\\'s biggest and best dramatic moment . \\nthe work of the young ensemble is so natural that they truly convince as teens of the early \\'60s ; they do not appear to be \\'90s grungers playacting \" retro . \" \\nyet for all the light , frothy charms of that thing you do ! , it\\'s nearly nice to a fault . \\nwhile this unbridled innocence in film is a refreshing change from all the sinful cinema around these days , there is not enough conflict to keep things consistently interesting . \\neveryone is so happy , basking in the glow of overnight success , marvelling at it all--except toward the end , but even then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness , ending on an appropriately feel-good note . \\nthere isn\\'t much of an edge throughout that thing--the only thing that is remotely edgy is hanks\\'s turn as the wonders\\' manager--and thus becomes in danger of being so nice it\\'s bland . \\nbut a little niceness goes a long way these days , and there\\'s no denying the entertainment value of that thing you do ! ; it\\'s just about impossible to hate . \\nit\\'s an inoffensive , enjoyable piece of nostalgia that is sure to leave audiences smiling and humming , if not singing , \" that thing you do ! \" --quite \\npossibly for days . \\nto paraphrase a passage from the song : though i try and try to forget that song it is just so hard to do every time they play \" that thing you do ! \" \\n', b'the event of events is upon us . \\npeople have waited twenty-two years for the prequel to star wars and die-hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it . \\ni don\\'t think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused . \\nit is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history . \\nanyone who tells you \" it\\'s just a movie \" is either lying or clueless . \\nit is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic . \\nthe second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz ( which is far too weak a word ) that star wars epsode i : the phantom menace so effortlessly generated . \\nbut that does not mean that the film itself is bad . \\nin fact , it is terrific . \\ni strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash . \\nit is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place . \\nthe film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging : the trade federation , angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small , peaceful planet of naboo . \\nthe republic sent two jedi knights ( people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as \" the force \" ) , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) to negotiate . \\nunable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur , the jedi and the queen of naboo ( natalie portman ) escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene . \\non the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine , where they meet the movie\\'s real focal point , young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) . \\nhe is an innocent slave boy , but \" the force is strong with him \" so qui- gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi . \\nas any self-respecting star wars fan should know , anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker . \\n>from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor\\'s movie . \\naround 70% of the characters , if not more , are computer generated in one form or another , and though the effects are seamless , the movie lacks soul . \\ni think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade , cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this . \\nthis is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far , with plenty of broad comic relief to go around , much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar-jar binks . \\nhe\\'s essentially a computer-animated sidekick who says things like \" exqueeze me ? \" \\nand \" mesa go now , okeday ? \" , and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying . \\nthe visual effects are astounding ( although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them ) and the movie is a thrilling triumph . \\nif it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement . \\nthe climactic lightsaber battle ( oh , come on , as if you didn\\'t already know ) , among other things , is outrageously entertaining and defines the term \" popcorn movie \" . \\nwhat made me surrender and give this movie * * * 1/2 stars was the score by john williams . \\neven though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days , his work here is nothing short of brilliant . \\nhis use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling . \\nthe phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia . \\nwhen you see \" a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away \" , when the familiar music plays , when the words \" star wars \" appear on screen , you\\'ll feel a tingle even if you didn\\'t see the movie when it first came out in \\'77 . \\nit feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin , a boy whose innocence , we know , will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side . \\nit is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts ; we know that it will do more harm than good , but they do not . \\nwe not only feel more involved in the story , but we feel like we\\'re seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years . \\nthe phantom menace , although lacking in human aspects of the story , is a very worthy installment in the star wars . \\nit works as an action flick , visually eye-popping and often paralyzingly exciting ; it also works as an elicitor of memories , a piece of exquisite nostalgia . \\n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \\n', b'there\\'s something about ben stiller that makes him a popular choice among casting directors these days . \\nstiller currently has three projects in circulation , and what other actor can lay claim to that ? \\nhe\\'s in \" there\\'s something about mary , \" which i * still * haven\\'t seen . \\nand he\\'s in the acerbic \" your friends & neighbors , \" playing a talkative , sexually-frustrated drama coach called jerri . \\nnow there\\'s \" permanent midnight , \" in which stiller plays another jerry , this one a heroin-addicted television writer , last name stahl . \\nthere\\'s also something about this industry that pushes bankable stars like stiller into doing drug-addiction pictures the minute they\\'ve proved themselves commercially . \\newan mcgregor springs to mind who , after successful turns in \" emma \" and \" brassed off , \" received greater respect and admiration for his mind-blowing realization as renton in danny boyle\\'s transatlantic junk-fest , \" trainspotting . \" \\nthe philosophy appears to be a simple one : if you want \\'em to be taken seriously , make \\'em do drugs . \\n \" permanent midnight \" is based on the true life experiences of jerry stahl , a successful hollywood writer who , in the mid-eighties , had a $5 , 000-a-week job churning out plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms and a $6 , 000-a-week heroin habit . \\na habit , in stahl\\'s own words , \" the size of utah . \" \\nas stahl , stiller contributes a commanding performance . \\nunlike \" trainspotting , \" which was successful in having it both ways by chronicling both the highs and the lows of heroin abuse , \" permanent midnight \" instead focuses on the concept of drug addiction as maintenance . \\none of the earliest observations in the film is a casual reference to \" naked lunch \" author william s . burroughs who , when asked why he shoots up first thing in the morning responds , \" so i can shave . \" \\nstahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill of it all in \" permanent midnight \" ; it\\'s so he can talk to his mother on the phone , show up for work on time , even pay his bills . \\nwhile the film itself occasionally wobbles around along with stahl , the writing ( adapted from stahl\\'s autobiography by director david veloz ) is controlled and pointed . \\n \" permanent midnight \" shows how stahl moved from new york to l . a . to--again in the author\\'s words-- \" escape the drug scene \" ( yeah , right ) ; why he entered into a convenient marriage with a british tv exec ( elizabeth hurley , so impossibly polite you\\'d swear her single profanity was dubbed ) ; and that he conceived a child in between his random hirings and firings . \\nstahl narrates all this in a motel bedroom to a sympathetic lover called kitty ( norristown\\'s own maria bello ) with whom he spent some rehab time . \\njaneane garofalo is wasted--and miscast--as a heavily-bespectacled hollywood talent agent who fails to get her hooks into the doped-up wordsmith , and that\\'s stahl himself playing a jaded clinic counselor . \\nstiller , unshaven ( burroughs take note ) and with lots of mascara around the eyes , has stahl stumble through the film looking like a train wreck but , to his credit , never once pushes his pill-popping , needle-jabbing performance over the top . \\nthe ubiquitous stiller is the reason to see \" permanent midnight \" ; a dark , comic , and strangely absorbing study of assisted living . \\n', b'dora ( fernanda montenegro ) sits behind a make-shift desk at rio+s major train station . \\nshe , in her colorful demeanor , offers a service that is unheard of in the states . \\nshe writes letters for the illiterate , who pass through , to try to find lost relatives , find love , or search after lost debts . \\nshe+s quirky , she+s elderly , she+s caring . \\ntotally trustworthy , right ? \\nnot a chance . \\nonce home , she never sends these letters , saving money on postage , and relishing in the drama contained therein with her neighbor irene ( mar ? lia p ? ra ) . \\none of the letters is sent by a young mother with her nine-year old son , looking for their father . \\nshortly thereafter , she gets hit by a bus , and the son is orphaned . \\ndays go by , and the boy , named josu ? , roams around the station , hungry , desperate , and somewhat clueless to his predictament . \\nthrough a series of circumstances too precious to elaborate upon , dora somehow takes a responsibility in trying to find josu ? +s father . \\nthis means leaving the security of rio , traveling to the outskirts of brazil , where unpaved roads , religious devotees and the poverty-stricken become commonplace . \\nfilms like this remind me as to what i enjoy about some foreign films . \\nit is an opportunity for me to get a fresh breath in another part of the world , so distant from my own . \\nit does so entertainingly , and so heart-wrenchingly . \\nand yet , it+s backdrop is merely that . \\nthe focus is on the minute transformation of dora , of how she learns to love this little kid , without being cloying or sentimental . \\nthe most interesting backdrop is the amount of religious dedication is in the film . \\ndora being an amoral scam-artist , could care less about the amount of bickering between the candle-lighting of the catholics versus the bumper-sticker mentality of the evangelicals . \\nbut neither side is trivialized . \\nshe even begins to develop an affection for a non-drinking evangelical , who sees the problems with dora , if not initially . \\nfernanda montenegro surprisingly got an oscar nomination for this very delicate performance , but the true marvel is that of vinicius de oliveira , who plays josu ? . \\nhe , like the discoveries of j ? r ? mie renier ( _la promesse_ ) and giorgio cantarini ( _life is beautiful_ ) , prove that the true acting discoveries may be outside of the united states . \\nhe is a natural , and never once grating . \\nsend a memo to jonathan taylor thomas . \\n', b\"among multitude of erotic thrillers , that had been released in the early 1990s , woman of desire is interesting only because it was directed by robert ginty , star of the b-grade action films of the previous decade . \\nthose who tend not to be nostalgic about 1980s can find very good reason in the type of movies that made ginty the star . \\nas director , ginty did very little to improve that impression . \\nthe protagonist of the movie is jack ( played by jeff fahey ) , yacht skipper that falls madly in love with christina ford ( played by bo derek ) . \\nhowever , she has relationship with rich and powerful jonathan ashby ( steven bauer ) . \\none stormy night , the tragedy occurs and jack is accused of rape and murder . \\nhowever , his good friend walter j . hill ( robert mitchum ) happens to be very good lawyer , so jack might even prove his innocence in the end . \\nbelonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller , woman of desire distinguishes itself from similar films by having almost all characters behaving like total idiots . \\nunfortunately , this film isn't comedy and any laugh is unintentional . \\nthe characters are totally antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen to them . \\nthe actors that play them don't help either . \\nthat is especially the case with jeff fahey , whose jack is so stupid that even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like a genius in comparison . \\nhis partner bo derek , on the other hand , shows that she didn't age enough to cease being the sex goddess , but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents . \\nginty , on the other hand , tries to bring some life in the movie by using many flashbacks and strange angles of shooting , but in the end it gets only irritating to the already bored and dissatisfied viewer . \\n\", b' \" in dreams \" might keep you awake at night , but not because of its creepy imagery , bizarre visual style or story about a clairvoyant madman who lures young girls to their untimely deaths . \\nno , the source of potential sleeplessness here lies within the movie\\'s brutally squandered potential , the least of which is an admittedly nifty premise - even by tired serial killer genre standards . \\nthe big letdown , however , comes upon the realization that this 100-minute head-scratcher was masterminded by neil jordan , the man behind \" the crying game . \" \\nhe\\'s no stranger to cinematic weirdness , but this nutty nonsense really pushes the envelope . \\nthings start out strong enough , with cinematographer darius khondji\\'s stunning camera work guiding viewers into the bowels of a underwater ghost town during a creepy prologue that establishes a notably grim tone right off the bat . \\nthis eerie opulence remains a dazzling display of showmanship throughout the entire film - there\\'s even something macabre about the way khondji photographs a rustic , seemingly innocent new england autumn - but if there ever was a film that didn\\'t deserve so good a polish , it\\'s this one . \\ndon\\'t knock the look , but say what you will about the foolish plot , underdeveloped characters and flat dialogue . \\nannette bening , another asset \" in dreams \" shouldn\\'t be so lucky to boast , gives an increasingly effective performance in a role that doesn\\'t do much for her in return . \\nshe plays claire cooper , a massachusetts children\\'s book illustrator who\\'s plagued by terrifying nightmares involving kidnaped children . \\nshe thinks these visions are a warning knell for horrible , soon-to-be-committed crimes , but neither her ho-hum husband ( aidan quinn ) nor the ho-hummer police can muster up the sense to take her seriously . \\nthis being a thriller , we know that she is , in fact , on the money , and it\\'s a credit to bening\\'s acting that she delves equally into claire\\'s madness and compassion . \\nbut as soon as a body turns up and claire has given the authorities reason enough to believe her claims , \" in dreams \" trades in its nifty supernatural chills for a long series of allegedly spooky jolts that simply refuse to make sense . \\nscenes pile up like a car wreck with little or no explanation or exposition . \\nsubplots appear and disappear . \\nwhen claire finally comes face-to-face with our evil murderer ( robert downey jr . ) , it turns out his name is vivian , he\\'s clairvoyant and he\\'s got some major issues with mama , a la norman bates . \\n \" in dreams \" reaches its absurdist zenith here , and the climax drags with mumbled revelations and laughable twists . \\nsome questions , then : what\\'s with the garbage disposal retching applesauce ? \\nare the drawings on the wall blood or paint ? \\nwho cranked up the andrews sisters on the cd player and caused the swing to move on its own ? \\nwhat about the computer ? \\ndoes vivian possess the gift of telekinesis in addition to his other powers ? \\nwhy would he continually endanger claire if she was necessary for his ultimate plan ? \\nis the woman in australia integral to anything ? \\nand the aforementioned flooded city - what function does that _really_ serve ? \\nsigh . \\nat least in my own dreams , i can imagine a better movie where certain talent didn\\'t go to waste . \\n', b'as african american detective vergil tibbs questions a suspected white murderer inside a jail cell , there is a wonderful , eye-catching shot which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film . \\nthe shot has tibbs\\' face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars . \\nto see these bars blocking his face , we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film . \\nas a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots , no matter how innocent tibbs is , he is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his skin . \\nthe bars show that tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly who he is , instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous . \\nthis one shot amazes me because it captures a whole theme in a matter of seconds . \\nit perhaps may be the most powerful image i have seen in a film . \\n \" in the heat of the night \" was the first and the best of the three films norman jewison directed concerning racism in america . \\njewison has a very keen style of displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental . \\nin these three films he does an excellent job creating very detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused to the abusers . \\nhe is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present . \\npreceding the very original \" a soldier\\'s story \" and the recently released \" the hurricane , \" \" in the heat of the night contains some classic lines and some very memorable characters . \\nthe film , which won best picture in 1967 focuses on vergil tibbs , played superbly by sidney poitier as a fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuses to give up on an investigation in a white town where is he not wanted . \\ntibbs is a man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him . \\nas a hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chains , tibbs is the perfect protagonist . \\npoitier also gives an excellent , noteworthy voice to his character . \\nnever nervous and always commanding , his speech patterns are very manipulative as they range from stentorian to soothing . \\nhowever , unlike \" the hurricane \" where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast , poitier shares the spotlight with rod steiger , who won best actor for his excellent performance . \\nas a sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him , steiger shows a great amount of skill in his role . \\nhe starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople . \\nhe would refer to tibbs as \" boy \" and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him . \\nas the film progresses though , there is a very gradual change in the sheriff . \\nhe begins to see the hardships tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors . \\nwhat i really enjoyed about steiger\\'s character was that he did not completely abandon his friends or connect with tibbs at the end of the film . \\nhe still could not refer to tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil . \\ninstead , it was apparent that he was eventually going to see the world differently in the future . \\nmost movies would have a character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in a matter of minutes . \\nthis action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day . \\njewison\\'s determination to make this film as realistic as possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate . \\n \" in the heat of the night \" shows the difference between the north and the south or a major city and a small town in the united states during the 1960\\'s . \\nit displays this perfectly . \\nhowever , the actual investigation , although it is not the main focus of the film , lacks interest . \\nit seemed rushed especially towards the end as if jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving a credible explanation involving the murder victim . \\nthere were way too many characters added during the last fifteen minutes and some of the scenes during this time period were inane ( police officer sam being a suspect was not needed ) . \\nalso , it is given that tibbs is a vigilant homicide detective who is the best at what he does , but some of his discoveries came out of nowhere and how he found out some of the important case details towards the end were never answered . \\nthe rushed ending was the only mistake of this otherwise memorable jewison classic . \\n ( a congratulations has to be given to actor scott wilson . \\nhe managed to be in the two best movies of 1967 , \" in the heat of the night \" and the even better \" in cold blood . \" ) \\n', b'plot : a young french boy sees his parents killed before his eyes by tim roth , oops . . . i \\nmean , an evil man . \\nhe vows revenge on that man and is taught the ways of the musketeer by some old dude who used to be one himself ? \\nanyway , fourteen years go by and . . . arrgh , well , you know the rest . . . swish-swish-zzzzzzz ! \\ncritique : this is a pretty bad movie . \\nlet\\'s see , where should i start ? \\nokay , first of all , the story is just plain boring . \\nit\\'s not original , is entirely predictable and lacks energy . \\nokay , what\\'s next ? \\nacting , you say . \\nhmmmm , well , the main actor , justin chambers , is basically an uncharismatic version of chris o\\'donnell but with less range ( think about that ! ) , and mena suvari , is just plain off . \\nnot as bad as thora birch was in dungeons & dragons , but entirely miscast , with bad deliveries , awful sequences and a piss-poor accent that comes and goes . \\nnow i\\'m not sure if this was ms . suvari\\'s fault or the director\\'s , but i\\'ve definitely seen her at a much higher level than in this film . \\nthe only semi-saving grace actor-wise is tim roth as the irrepressible \" bad guy \" , but once again , it\\'s not something that we haven\\'t seen before . . . a \\nthousand times . . . by the same guy ! ! \\ntim , please . . . for the love of god , beg your agent to ask the marketplace for some modern day \" american roles \" for you as a \" nice guy \" in a romantic comedy or something . \\nstretch , dude . . . stretch ! ! \\nwe all know that you can do much better than this gunk . \\nalright , what else was bad in this film ? \\noh yeah , the score ! \\nyikes , how\\'s about taking it down a few notches there , fellas ? \\nthis thing blares in your ear whenever it feels the need to accentuate a certain scene , but actually does little more than annoy . \\ni think it\\'s important for the man behind the music to recognize that this film isn\\'t a \" real epic \" by any stretch of the imagination . \\nit\\'s a fluffy rehashed cake-walk created by some \" shrewd \" studio heads who decided to take advantage of the whole \" kung-fu \" phenomenon in films , and test it out on an old classic . \\ndudes . . . you \\nfailed all around ! \\n ( keep reading ) \\nthe editing is also pretty shoddy in this movie , the dialogue banal and stilted and the plot problems . . . plentiful ! \\n ( why does the guy on top of the horse carriage just stand there when his opponent takes forever scampering his way back to the top ? \\nwhy don\\'t they just cut the mouseketeer\\'s rope at the top of the tower , instead of jumping down on their own chords and fighting him while hanging ? \\nwhy doesn\\'t anybody look a day older , when the sequence says \" 14 years later \" ? \\n ( at least . . . change \\nyour shirt , man ! ) \\nkeep in mind that i have never strayed away from championing certain movies that are created simply for the sake of a \" fun time \" , but this flick just didn\\'t cut it for me . \\nit was boring for stretches , the acting was atrocious at times ( the \" romantic \" scene between suvari and chambers next to the lake reminded me of plays in high school which made you cringe ) , there was little reason to care for anyone and since when were the musketeers fat ? \\ni will give the movie this much , and that is that its main reason for being ( its \" raison-d\\'etre \" , as the french would say ) , its fight sequences , do come through despite the lack of their numbers in the film . \\ni was hoping that the movie would be packed with cool stuntwork as promoted in its trailer , but what you see there , are essentially the snippets from the two major ( and cool ) swashbuckling sequences from the film . \\nthe first comes right at the beginning of the movie , while the other essentially finishes the film off , hanging from the tower and juggling off ladders . \\nthe ladder sequence itself is a definite keeper but unfortunately the rest of the movie is just regurgitated crap . \\nand can anyone please tell me how catherine deneuve got her name placed at the top of this film\\'s credits ? \\nhullo ? \\nthe film is called the musketeer and stars a dude name justin chambers . \\ndeneuve is barely in this movie ! \\nugh , just another small thing that annoyed me about this trash . \\nnow say it together , gang : \" all for one , and one for all . . . we \\nvow to stay away from it all ! ! \" \\nthank me later . \\nwhere\\'s joblo coming from ? \\na knight\\'s tale ( 7/10 ) - american outlaws ( 5/10 ) - crouching tiger , hidden dragon ( 7/10 ) - the matrix ( 8/10 ) - the

-- directed by joe dante and written by charles hass -- \\nsummary : lawrence woolsley ( john goodman ) brings his new horror film mant ! \\nto premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis . \\nhe hopes to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town . \\nwe see most of the events through the stories of four teenagers and how life affects them . \\nquick and easy review : i really enjoyed matinee . \\nthe mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely . \\nunlike many comedies this film tries , and succeeds , in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh . \\nthe makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story . \\nthe performances of all the principals are right on the mark , particularly john goodman as the schlock master . \\nso i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted , yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours . \\nlonger , more detailed review : [beware of spoilers] \\nthe primary reason i enjoyed this film was , that while being a comedy , the film also had an intelligent story to tell . \\ntoo many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh . \\nyou watch the movie , laugh a lot , leave the theatre and take nothing with you . \\nmatinee is not like that . \\ni left the picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis . \\ni found myself wondering what would happen to the characters of the film . \\nbut most importantly , i found myself caring about what would happen to the characters . \\nthe comedy of the film centers around goodman , his character , and the film he brings to key west . \\ni believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today . \\nhe is highly expressive both physically and vocally . \\ni felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink . \\nthe other characters are often lost in a scene with him due to his commanding nature , however , while the star , goodman is actually not at the center of the film . \\nthe movie is really the story of the four teenagers , discovering who they are and what they want , against a background where at any minute it could all end . \\ni thought the kids reaction were highly realistic . \\nthey tried to block it out , they tried to escape from the concerns of their world . \\nunfortunately it kept creeping back in , particularly with the fear , and the chaos of the time . \\nwhile the comedy centered on goodman , and the drama on the teens , there was a great deal of overlap . \\nseveral aspects of the panic are shown in a humorous light . \\none example is a scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans and boxes of food in a grocery store . \\nif you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for a comedy , but it works here . \\nanother reason i like this film is that i like b- science fiction movies . \\none of my favorite films to go watch is plan 9 from outer space . \\n ( note i did not say it was one of my favorite movies , but one of my favorite to see . ) \\nwhile mant ! \\nnever got made , many films like it were , and mant ! \\nserves mostly as dante's homage to the b-films he loves . \\nso again i would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for a good , humorous story . \\nthis isn't a gag film like many other comedies but an intelligent , well-thought out , film about real people with real problems told in an often hilarious way . \\nenjoy ! \\n\", b'carry on matron is the last great carry-on film in my opinion . \\nmade in 1972 , it still features most of the regulars of this genre . \\nsid james plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit , kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting , head of the hospital but also a hypochondriac , hattie jacques re-takes her role as matron , and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr . goode . \\nthe jokes come in fast and so do the laughs , with humorous antics between the matron and sir bernard . \\nthis time , williams is after matron ( jacques ) when he needs to prove himself that he is a man after visiting dr . goode . \\nthe doctor ( hawtrey ) is sworn to secrecy : - \" i assure you , that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other ! \" \\nbernard thinks he is having a sex change and needs to prove himself . \\nthere are great cameos from joan sims , an expectant mother who is many weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene , and from kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks he\\'s at work ( at the railway station ) . \\nsid james\\' gang including cyril his son ( kenneth cope ) try to find out where the pills are by getting cyril to dress up as a nurse and live in at the nurses home . \\nhe has to share a room with nurse ball ( barbara windsor ) and she soon sees through him ! \\nthe film ends with the attempted robbery of the hospital\\'s pills with panic ensuing . \\nthere are good performances by hattie jacques as the matron , however her character seems a little more subdued and quieter than her previous \\'matron\\'s\\' . \\nwilliams is , as usual , on top form , but sid james isn\\'t given a very good part in this movie and i would forgive anyone to forget that he was in the movie at all . \\nthe same does not go for charles hawtrey , for although he only first appears in the movie after 30 minutes gone and has scarce screen time , he seems to steal every scene he is in . \\nby not making use of sid james and barbara windsor\\'s talent to full effect , the film seems to flounder , but it certainly makes up for it with it\\'s good storyline and it\\'s other appealing characters . \\nthis film is genuinely funny and i could watch it again and again and not get bored ! \\n', b\"synopsis : in this movie , steven spielberg , one of today's finest directors , attempts to spice up the 1800s story of a long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque ( djimon hounsou ) - - a young angry man from sierra leone who was kidnapped into slavery - - and his fellow prisoners . \\ncinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders , but since the americans don't speak cinque's language , the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slaves . \\ntechnically , since the international slave trade was outlawed at that time , people like cinque couldn't be kidnapped into slavery ; one had to be born a slave to be legally considered a slave . \\nlawyers baldwin and adams ( matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins ) must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery , rather than born slaves , in order to get them out of prison as free men . \\nthree lengthy court cases are portrayed with spielberg's trademark panache - - flashy beginning , lots of facial close-ups , big music , and dramatic imagery . \\na final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened to the various characters . \\nopinion : making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life . \\nin fiction , one invents purposeful , clear-cut good guys and bad guys , puts the fictional characters in conflict , and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion . \\nreal life , however , consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around , think thoughts and do nothing , or come and go before events are resolved . \\nspielberg gives us a visually spicy and historically accurate real life story . \\ndjimon hounsou and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performances . \\n\", b'instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoers will undoubtedly label as \" powerful \" or \" touching \" . \\ni have a name for it myself : \" gross \" . \\nthis is the sort of film where somebody stands up to a bully , the bully looks at the \" rebel \" threateningly , about to hurt him , and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too . \\nhow that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me : aren\\'t present day moviegoers beyond being \" inspired \" by something like that ? \\nthis is one example ( there are actually some more in instinct alone ) of filmmakers insulting the audience\\'s intelligence . \\ninstinct\\'s plot is brimming with potential : world-renowned anthropologist ethan powell ( anthony hopkins ) disappeared for two years whilst doing research in the jungles of africa . \\nhe was found and is coming back to the united states a convicted killer ; he murdered to african policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him . \\nafter committing a few more brutal acts of violence in the airport , the authorities stick him in a prison\\'s \" psychotics ward \" . \\nassigned to do an evaluation on powell is a bright ( or so we are told ) young psychiatrist theo caulder ( cuba gooding jr . ) . \\ncaulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career . \\nof course ( and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way ) he starts really caring for powell and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not a psychotic and that he should not be in prison . \\nand then there\\'s the inevitable \" heartless meanie \" character , in the form of donald sutherland who plays caulder\\'s mentor . \\nhe cares for caulder but does everything he can to discourage him from helping powell . \\nlet\\'s get one thing straight : dr . theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist i have ever seen , on screen or off . \\nany good shrink will listen to what his patient has to say no matter the subject because any good shrink will learn a great deal about his patient that way . \\nnot good old theo . \\nno , he asks purposefully pointed questions and when powell dares to venture to another subject caulder says \" we need to talk about this right now . \" \\nthis is a flaw only in the sense that it detracts from instinct\\'s already dubious credibility ; unfortunately it\\'s also the least of its problems . \\ndirector jon turteltaub , who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon as well as the surprisingly above-par cool runnings decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that , contrary to what this movie\\'s promotion would have you believe , it has much more in common with patch adams than with the silence of the lambs . \\nit\\'s not the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tears to your eyes ( what dreams may come aptly demonstrated that ) but the kind that brings vomit up your esophagus ( excuse the graphic depiction ) . \\nit aims to \" inspire \" rather than to touch hearts . \\nas yoda would say , inspire it does not . \\nit is the ultimate sign of futility when a screenwriter ( the very experienced gerald di pego ) has to resort to literally telling the audience a movie\\'s story . \\nindeed , somewhere in the beginning of instinct , one of the characters actually reads aloud the film\\'s plot to another character . \\nthis , like the instance i mentioned in the first paragraph of this review , is a horrid insult to our intelligence . \\ni am forced to wonder whether turteltaub and di pego did not think that we could figure out what instinct is about simply from regular conversation . \\ni think that anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors , and he chews the scenery in this movie , brilliant as ever . \\noscar winner cuba gooding jr . on the other hand is dreadful . \\nhis performance is at least part of what makes his character seem so incapable of being a shrink . \\ni liked the guy in jerry maguire as well as in as good as it gets but here he fails to project any shred of credibility or real feeling . \\ni love animals , and instinct\\'s prominent save the gorillas/live in harmony with nature theme is certainly something i could sympathize with . \\nhowever this movie\\'s execution is completely unacceptable . \\ntone down the violence and this will be a chick flick . \\n ?

mining town for trial back home nwhen she and her comrade appropriately dubbed the commander the rookie and the guy with the cool accent discover the town resident slaughtered they are forced to team up with williams to escape from the remaining resident head chopping alien possessed clutch nfilled with lovely overuse of storytelling flashback flash sideways and viewpoint change ghost of mar is hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and ill conceived action sequence nthe only thing keeping this film from becoming an incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity of it story nripped straight from the page of 1970s zombie movie ghost leap from one convenient moment to the next stopping only to kill the character which are most convenient to lose nattempts at character interaction and development are rare and forced nmost of these moment come off a kwik mart wisdom dispensed heartily around the slushee machine of life by the even tempered streetwise hand of ice cube nwith gun in one hand and dynamite cap in the other cube reminisces about his street life comparing the zombie stomping fun to me and my brother when we wa kid napparently crime in the bronx ha gotten so bad that the resident have actually taken to ritually decapitating one another for entertainment nbut even in the film darkest moment fate conveniently lends hand supplying heavily armored transportation and easily accessible rifle and dynamite nyes in the future man may travel to space and conquer mar but nothing beat good stick of tnt nand a we all know every police station past present or future keep healthy supply on hand ncharacters die head are lopped off but they were only supporting role anyway so why should we care na long a you have plenty of narcotic immunity is guaranteed neventually though even the most well trained zombie alien get bit uppity and need to be taught lesson nwhat better way than by sacrificing few minor character to convenient nuclear detonation killing anything the machine gun can handle nexplosions are fun nand even if the nuke don get them the conveniently placed dynamite pack on the train stolen from the set of the road warrior certainly will nin the end this film defines itself when our cop tribunal pronounces is that all you have to tell u nfor indeed john carpenter ha run out of thing to say and ha instead decided to use

right ni have lost something ni didn always feel this sedated nwith that piece of dialogue we are fully introduced to lester burnham kevin spacey 42 year old man trapped within his own life nlester work for an advertising agency nhis growing dissatisfaction with his job is only one of the mid life crisis he is suffering nestranged from both his wife and his daughter lester start to crack under the stress nhis life becomes nothing more than series of mastubatory fantasy and sullen apathy ncarolyn burnham annette bening is the prototypical career woman homemaker nshe carefully tends her rose garden decorates her home with the best furnishing nbut inside she is desperate nunsuccessful at her profession a real estate agent she drive herself into state of denial and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family nthe third member of this anti family is jane burnham thora birch lester and carolyn daughter na young girl going through the typical stage of adolescence but having to also come to term with her family growing dysfunction nthis funny and frightening slice of life is refreshingly simple nnot one character is given le than is needed to identify him or her nsome of the most telling character are those that serve to highlight other character nmost notably is barbara fitts allison janney the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts nshe ha almost no dialogue and seems to be either recovering from stroke or suffering from one ncolonel fitts chris cooper is an angry and frightened man nhis rage directed almost singularly at his son ricky wes bentley who ha just moved with his family to the same neighborhood a the burnham nin fact they are the next door neighbor nanymore detail into the personality of these marvelously diverse character would deprive one of the many pleasure and surprise to be had in american beauty nalan ball who wa the co executive producer of the hit tv series cybil and creator of the new sitcom oh grow up ha fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplay to have hit the screen in the past ten year nnot one character in this film ring falsely nand the depth of personality in each is achingly honest and insightful nthe plot detailing the last year in the life of man a he try to find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched and at the same time original a to bring to mind such marvelous film work a the graduate or lolita nkevin spacey turn in one of this year most pragmatic performance nhis lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of life that is spiraling into old age nfinally unable to deal with the lost soul that he ha become lester try to return to his youth nhe quits his job actually blackmailing his employer for one year salary start smoking pot fantasizes about his daughter girlfriend angela mena suvari in marvelous performance here start working out and finally take job at the local fast food outlet nmr spacey performance is so remarkably subtle and ingenuous that we can be certain that come oscar time we can be assured to see him name among the five nominee nannette bening also turn in what may be the best performance of her career ncarolyn burnham is woman who ha become so insecure a to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy nunable to cope with her growing disillusionment she force herself to maintain her demeanor driving her further and further into desperation adultery and possibly murder nm bening make the character of carolyn so compelling a to be identifiable to almost anyone nthe slow and methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express in word nthora birch hold her own against the talent cast with her njane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in what is dysfunctional family and rebellious child ready to abandon them at any moment nher growing distrust and isolation from her family is something that many parent should view a warning nshe is the prototypical trophy child nwhen carolyn praise her daughter after performance by her cheerleading team m so proud of you honey nyou didn screw up once the bitterness and resentment are palpable nthora birch is young actress to watch npraise must also go to chris cooper who brings yet another angry father role to life with depth and resonance ncolonel finn is man in complete denial nhis military upbringing masking desire he is too repulsed to even comprehend nwes bentley a ricky finn is fine a the enigma nthe boy next door who may be more foe than friend na deceitful and calculating young man whose voyeuristic proclivity mask deeper and more profound understanding of life than any of the adult around him nmr bentley performance is the one troublesome note in the film nthat is simply because the character is such grand and complete liar that one almost fault the performance for it ndirector sam mendes handle all of the particular of the cast and the setting with sure and composed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle nscenes of carolyn walking through the rain carry an ominous fission that call attention to the emotion of the character nthe subtle cinematography by conrad hall is wonderful capturing the season in all of it harsh beauty fall ha never looked so inviting yet depressing nevery nuance of american beauty begs it audience to think and examine nit is film that will be discussed and debated for year to come nand well it should a it is simply one of this year best', 'it is movie like these that make jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch nbased on the late 1960 television show by the same name the mod squad tell the tale of three reformed criminal under the employ of the police to go undercover nhowever thing go wrong a evidence get stolen and they are immediately under suspicion nof course the ad make it seem like so much more nquick cut cool music claire dane nice hair and cute outfit car chase stuff blowing up and the like nsounds like cool movie doe it not nafter the first fifteen minute it quickly becomes apparent that it is not nthe mod squad is certainly slick looking production complete with nice hair and costume but that simply isn enough nthe film is best described a cross between an hour long cop show and music video both stretched out into the span of an hour and half nand with it come every single clich nit doesn really matter that the film is based on television show a most of the plot element have been recycled from everything we ve already seen nthe character and acting is nothing spectacular sometimes even bordering on wooden nclaire dane and omar epps deliver their line a if they are bored which really transfer onto the audience nthe only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi who play the resident crazy man ultimately being the only thing worth watching nunfortunately even he not enough to save this convoluted mess a all the character don do much apart from occupying screen time nwith the young cast cool clothes nice hair and hip soundtrack it appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset ndespite an american rating which the content doe not justify the film is way too juvenile for the older mindset ninformation on the character is literally spoon fed to the audience would it be that hard to show u instead of telling u dialogue is poorly written and the plot is extremely predictable nthe way the film progress you likely won even care if the hero are in any jeopardy because you ll know they aren nbasing the show on 1960 television show that nobody remembers is of questionable wisdom especially when one considers the target audience and the fact that the number of memorable film based on television show can be counted on one hand even one that missing finger or two nthe number of time that checked my watch six is clear indication that this film is not one of them nit is clear that the film is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the teenage spending dollar judging from the rash of really awful teen flick that we ve been seeing a of late navoid this film at all cost', 'moviemaking is lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post salary cap era you ve got to know how to allocate your resource nevery dollar spent on free agent defensive tackle is one le dollar than you can spend on linebacker or safety or center nin the nfl this lead to team like the detroit lion who boast superstar running back with huge contract but can only field five guy named herb to block for him nin the movie you end up with film like spawn with huge special effect budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actor njackie chan is the barry sander of moviemaking nhe spin and dart across the screen like sander cutting back through the defensive line nwatching jackie in operation condor a he drive his motorcycle through the crowded street of madrid fleeing an armada of pursuer in identical black compact car is reminiscent of sander running for daylight with the chicago bear in hot pursuit except that sander doesn have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriage nbut like the lion star jackie doesn have anybody to block for him nalmost every cent that invested in jackie chan movie go for stunt and a chan doe his own stunt the rest of the money go to pay his hospital bill nthis leaf about 75 cent to pay for thing like director chan directs script and dubbing and supporting character not to mention the hideous title sequence nthis also explains why the movie wa shot in odd place like morocco and spain chan first release in this country rumble in the bronx wa supposedly set in new york but wa filmed in vancouver and in the chase scene the canadian rockies are clearly visible nheck jackie doesn even have enough money for haircut look like much le personal hairstylist nin condor chan play the same character he always played himself mixture of bruce lee and tim allen master of both kung fu and slapstick fu njackie is sent by the un to retrieve cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert and is chased by horde of neo nazi sympathizer and two stereotypical arab one of the thing like about jackie chan movie no political correctness nhe is joined by three woman who have little to do except scream jackie save u and misuse firearm nthe villain is an old nazi whose leg were broken in the secret base so that he ha to be carried everywhere and he more pathetic than evil nen route we have an extended motorcycle chase scene hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with the neo nazi and two confrontation with savage native nonce at the secret desert base there is long chop socky sequence followed by the film centerpiece wind tunnel fight that even better than the one in face off nthis is where the money wa spent on well choreographed kung fu sequence on giant kevlar hamster ball on smashed up crate of banana and on scorpion nignore the gaping hole in the plot how exactly if the villain leg were broken did he escape from the secret nazi base and why didn he take the key with him ndon worry about the production value or what exactly the japanese girl wa doing hitchhiking across the sahara njust go see the movie noperation condor ha pretentions of being raider of the lost ark knockoff but one wonder what jackie could do with the raider franchise blocking for him with lawrence kazdan screenplay john williams score spielberg directing and george lucas producing condor might be an movie nhowever you ve got to go with what you ve got and what you ve got in jackie chan is something special talent that mainstream hollywood should could and ought to utilize', 'he back and it about time nwas the motto for this television series pilot call it pilot don care what fox network say revival of the cult classic british tv show doctor who that spawned no series which mean there are no smart network exec out there not exactly news to lot of people know nthe motto wa well chosen nthe series wa simple it wa about this time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen life who traveled around in type forty spaceship called tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddie including the evil daleks and the master who appears in this feature played very badly by eric robert na good a this revival wa there is something missing from it to make sure it wa really doctor who ni it the acting nhell no npaul mcgann is just a good a any of the other seven guy who ve played the doctor including his predecessor and off screen friend sylvester mccoy who appears once more for the regeneration scene nhe look right for the role is brilliant actor and slip effortlessly into the role the way my two favorite jon pertwee and tom baker would ndaphne ashbrook brings class to her role a dr grace holloway the doctor first companion that he kiss on screen she is not your typical female companion who scream and spends her free time making coffee for the doctor she is tough spunky american and ashbrook show this well nyoung yee jee tso show promise a chang lee and ve seen him in other stuff in which he usually play the punk kid who dy at the end this film included which imho waste his talent nthe only problem with the acting is eric robert none time he had to say to mcgann doctor always dress for the occasion nbut he broke it up and said it so slowly that it wounded up sounding like song lyric always ndress nfor the occasion nyou need an actor le slow and le reliant on moving his hand to act and who also british like mcgann is a the doctor nexecutive producer phil segal said he wa casted because fox insisted on having one american star in the role ni dunno who thought of casting him but if they re reading this news flash eric robert is not star nhe ride on his sister coattail and any hit movie he make ha nothing to do with him ni this problem the kiss to the past nthey have reference to the show so subtle that non fan would not notice them only whovians would and they re good ni it the script or the movie a whole nthe script is classy piece of work featuring master who can spit slime out of his mouth and nice dialogue and the movie a whole is one fan will love and it is good stand alone viewing for nonfans to enjoy the series nso what is it nsimple no plot nthe master on his last leg sends for the doctor to rescue him after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro and exterminate him nthe doctor attempt to take his remains back to gallifrey but they accidentally land in san francisco 1999 december 31 where the master with young street hood chang lee help open the eye of harmony which will suck the earth through it at midnight if the doctor with the help of female surgeon dr grace holloway doesn close it by then nvirtually no plot ni wa told the movie would ve featured the daleks on screen and started with more of courtroom drama between the master and the daleks but lot of rewriting went on on the set nthat show how smart people are a it would have made the movie hell of lot more interesting and that would ve gotten four star rating out of me', 'in wonder boy michael douglas play an aged writer professor with such lived in naturalism that believe it may be his best performance never since wall street douglas ha spent the greater part of his career playing variation on the shark in suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid 80 nin those performance he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intention to the world nyou think such man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath good natured veneer but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton douglas played the role straight and out in the open nin wonder boy his performance isn showy or tour de force it simple yet truthful nhe embodies grady craggy old writer with predilection for pot and pink bathrobe ngrady instructs writer workshop while working tirelessly on follow up to the novel that put him on the map nwhen we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack a student bombard one of their own with unfair criticism ngrady point out in his narration that they only do so out of jealousy ntheir target is the very writerly named james leer played by the always understated tobey maguire student full of potential and one whom grady develops mild affection for nleer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotion nhe speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just hint of dry wit around the edge nhe portentous and gloomy a if modeling himself after the great depressed writer though his act is little too calculated nhe reminds me of the self imposed outcast film director jim jarmusch dead man ghost dog nwhenever happen to catch jarmusch in an interview see the man speaking in toneless manner the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer exclusively dressed in black and with his spiked hair dyed snow white nleer is similar guy who equates quirk with depth ntobey maguire fit well in the role nwith his round sweet eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude nbut unlike cort maguire is easier to warm up to he a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility nkatie holmes play hannah beautiful talented writing student just itching to get in grady pant nthis is plot line had trouble with ndouglas in his old age is beginning to resemble jerry springer man who ha actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasion nat first found it extremely difficult to believe that someone a beautiful a hannah would desire grady maybe it because m jealous and wish holmes wa throwing herself at me after all may just be lowly internet critic but at least still have all my teeth then think of douglas real life companion the breathtaking catherine zeta jones nseeing those two together look lot like kidnapping nsuddenly my mind ha shifted from the task at hand that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie and m pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas nthere is movie in there somewhere ngrady rather chivalrously if you ask me resists the charm of hannah for sara gaskell droll france mcdormand who is his age but also married to another professor nokay maybe not so chivalrous nthere is great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he say she wa junkie for the printed word nlucky for me manufactured her drug of choice nrobert downy r play bisexual editor who make his entrance with towering transvestite on his arm ndowny ha mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many hipster intellectual nhe arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance nthe actor is perfectly cast here and remains joyous movie presence somewhere between typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor ni wish wonder boy had more of him nsearching for plot among the element of wonder boy would be pointless for it meander through it running time but that part of it charm nand maybe m bit biased towards the film because it take place in haven of literary academia place m greatly fond of and place rarely explored in american cinema neveryone ha sub genre be it war film western dance movie that they happen to be privy to ni privy to film about literary type e nthose individual enthralled by the written word and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half notch nthe direction by curtis hanson is more akin to european film with it leisurely pace and situation that grow from the character rather than generic mapped out story point nsometimes the dialogue is too clever but that a problem wish found with film more often nanother minor quibble is that early on the film seems bit too introverted like it character but a the story progress it begin to open up nfor me wonder boy work a subtle drama because of it insight into artistic type and a low key comedy for it chuckle worthy throwaway gag nthe gag are like those in the great robert altman a h the long goodbye movie where joke exist a aside on the fringe like joke in life often do nthe broader comedy such a the killing of blind dog and incessant smoking of marijuana isn ineffective but not nearly a memorable a the little thing ncurtis hanson who before his last film la confidential toiled about with exploitation fare like losin it an early tom cruise sex comedy and the hand the rock the cradle ha graduated to more meaningful film nhe directs wonder boy in an appropriately dour style the comedy coming from the false gloom his character put up nthe morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party but in wonder boy party it fit nthe film is like piece of literature put up on the big screen nit the cinematic equivalent to good read novelistic in it approach with theme rarely found in american movie nmany will find it slight but found much to savor among it subtlety', 'm really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone nsure she is one of the most beautiful creature on god green earth second only to that movie critic at large guy but when it come to choosing what movie she star in she always strike out nthe crush wa slow moving predictable piece of fluff nhideaway wa horrific novel adaptation alicia had only minor role in nclueless wa an annoying unfunny waste of time nand people have mailed me too saying clueless is good movie and that m the only one who doesn like it none girl said if d seen the movie with an open mind would have enjoyed it nnothing could be further from the truth ni went into the theater expecting to love the movie nthe preview looked good and of course m crazymadinlove with alicia but the movie wa bunch of bad joke coming from whiny unlikable character nalmost everyone saw the movie with felt the same way nwhen we were walking out of the theater one guy and it wasn me yelled out that wa the worst in movie ve ever seen and the rest of u had to laugh in agreement nso last night walked into the video store and saw alicia pretty face on the cover of some made for video thriller called the babysitter ni knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion ll probably never understand made me rent it anyway nwhat got wa 90 minute of regret the worst alicia silverstone movie ever nand you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like nwhere to begin in criticizing this movie nthe plot is thin shred that move slower than glacier the writing could have been done and for all we know it wa by ten year old alicia is the star and she still wasted in movie that ha no appeal whatsoever nthere is zero humor zero suspense zero drama and zero action until the last ten minute when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with violent sequence nzero plus zero plus zero plus zero equal zero nso why doe this movie get one star out of me nwell alicia spends twenty minute of the movie in the bathtub nand if it wasn bubble bath the babysitter would have instantly joined the rank of our other four star feature but you settle for what you can get nalicia play babysitter who spending friday night looking after two kid whose parent are out getting drunk at cocktail party nand of course anyone a beautiful a alicia automatically spends their friday night at home at least that movie critic at large guy doe na the movie trods along we discover she not only the mostly silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character fantasy and probably every male viewer too nthe drunken father think she just the thing to recapture his lost youth her boyfriend let his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside even the prepubescent boy look in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she taking her bubble bath nthey even throw in the middle aged wife fantasy about male counterpart at the party nnot that any of u asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200 pound woman in black silk teddy nat least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg rated nin fact could imagine the babysitter becoming cinemax late night staple if not for the fact that there absolutely no nudity in it nso you can call it sex flick ni ve already pointed out that it can fall under drama comedy thriller or action so what do you classify the babysitter a nbad', 'plot young man who love heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon to whom he devoted tribute band in which he sings get launched into stardom when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his place ncritique m sucker for movie like this na young man with humble background and lofty dream work hard devotes the time the energy and the patience and ultimately hit it big time nin the case of this film our boy love certain heavy metal band and a luck would have it yup luck always find it way into these type of equation although generally tied very closely to hard work they need new singer nhis entry and adaptation to the whole rock roll lifestyle fill the rest of the film and is really fun to watch nalthough will preface this by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love or past love of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it nmetal wa one of my first love a teen and even though the genre of music isn that prominent anymore still check out my motley crue twisted sister and anthrax cd every now and again nthat not to say that you won like this film if you don like the music but the music and live performance from the band play big part in the movie and for one had blast watching and listening to it all nbut the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by mark wahlberg nwow hand this fella some major prop a he totally becomes this heavy metal geek god incidentally metal god wa the film original title and much better one if you ask me nhe is this movie and wa quite taken by his character pretty much the whole way through nhe came off like regular guy with extremely passionate goal and work ethic who wa willing to do anything in order to fulfill his dream naniston wa also surprisingly good a the girlfriend and the romance angle between them wa sweet but she didn pull me in hard enough during their emotional scene ni wa also impressed by some of the real musician who played in the film zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne jeff pilson from dokken stephan jenkins from third eye blind blas elia from slaughter but actor dominic west a kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band member nit to note that this film wa based on real life tale of young man who used to sing in juda priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer their original singer also admitted to being gay a in this film njust for the record m certainly not recommending this film for it originality or surprise element since most of this stuff ha already been covered in some way or another in other movie but because it a fun uplifting well paced movie with solid central showing by wahlberg and energetic live performance noh yeah and for those who dig the heavier side of music the soundtrack also rock nyou see dream ncan come true nwhere joblo coming from nalmost famous 8 10 blow 8 10 boogie night 9 10 detroit rock city 8 10 girlfight 6 10 goodfellas 10 10', 'jaw is rare film that grab your attention before it show you single image on screen nthe movie open with blackness and only distant alien like underwater sound nthen it come the first ominous bar of composer john williams now infamous score ndah dum nfrom there director steven spielberg waste no time taking u into the water on midnight swim with beautiful girl that turn deadly nright away he let u know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean and once jaw ha attacked it never relinquishes it grip nperhaps what is most outstanding about jaw is how spielberg build the movie nhe work it like theatrical production with first act and second act nunlike so many modern filmmaker he ha great deal of restraint and refuse to show u the shark until the middle of the second act nuntil then he merely suggests it presence with creepy subjective underwater shot and williams music nhe building the tension bit by bit so when it come time for the climax the shark arrival is truly terrifying nhe doesn let u get bored with the imagery nthe first act open with police chief martin brody roy scheider new york cop who ha taken an easy peaceful job running the police station on amity island fictitious new england resort town where there hasn been murder or gun fired in 25 year nthe island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attack right before the fourth of july and the mayor larry vaughn murray hamilton doesn want to shut down the beach because the island is reliant on summer tourist money nbrody is joined by matt hooper richard dreyfus young ambitious shark expert from the marine institute nhooper is a fascinated by the shark a he is determined to help brody stop it his knowledge about the exact working of the shark it a perfect engine an eating machine make it that much more terrifying nwhen vaughn finally relents hooper and brody join crusty old shark killer named quint robert shaw on his decrepit boat the orca to search for the shark nthe entire second act take place on the orca a the three men hunt the shark and inevitably are hunted by it jaw is thriller with keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing tension and horror nit is like ten movie all rolled into one and it no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time until it wa unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by star war neven today fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock psycho and it never seems to age nalthough grand new technology exists that make the technical sequence including several mechanical shark obsolete none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill nthe technical limitation faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic element like pacing characterization sharp editing and creative photography instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effect nscheider dreyfus and shaw were known actor at the time jaw wa made but none of them had the draw of robert redford or paul newman nnevertheless this film guaranteed them all successful career because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark nscheider hit just the right note a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what right and going against the entire town it your first summer here you know mayor vaughn warns him ndreyfuss who had previously been seen in american graffiti 1973 and the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz 1974 give surprisingly mature complex performance for someone who had literally only played kid and teenager nhowever most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw a the movie captain ahab performance sorely overlooked by the academy award nbordering of parody shaw play quint a grizzled old loner whose machismo border on masochism nhe slightly deranged and shaw performance is almost caricature nhowever there is one scene late in the film when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scar nquint is drawn into telling the story of his experience aboard the s nindianapolis navy ship in world war ii that wa sunk by the japanese nhis tale of floating in the water for more than week with over 1 000 other men while swarm of shark slowly devoured them them is actually more hair raising than anything spielberg put on screen nshaw delivers the story in one long take and it is the best acting in the film nof course we can leave out the shark itself with it black eye endless row of teeth and insatiable urge to eat it is basically the epitome of all mankind fear about what is unknown and threatening in nature na shark is such perfect nemesis it is real having survived sinch the dinosaur great white do exist they can be a large a the shark in jaw and they are threat nevery one of spielberg subjective underwater shot make u feel queasy because let u see how we look to the shark bunch of writihing dangling completely unprotected leg just ready to be chomped into nthe shark in jaw wa actually combination of actual footage and five different mechanical shark all nicknamed bruce by the crew built to be shot from different angle nmany have forgotten but jaw wa sort of precursor to waterworld 1995 movie who soggy production and cost overrun had universal studio worried about bomb nbut a we can see now spielberg overcame all the obstacle and delivered one of the finest primal scare thriller ever to come out of hollywood', 'the ultimate match up between good and evil the untouchable is an excellent movie because it look deeper into an already examined rivalry nbased on the 1959 television show of the same title the untouchable may be an exaggeration of the real life event that took place but it fit together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequence some excellent acting memorable score and clever script nthe film take place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobster led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public nelliot ness and small force of men known a the untouchable attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order nhowever a ness soon learns in order to stabilize peace you have to bend few law nthe fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scene nthe film begin with capone played perfectly by deniro declaring that he is not violent man and he is firm believer in following all law nthe film then quickly transfer to the next scene in which one of capone men bomb restaurant that contains many innocent people including little girl nfrom this point we know capone is evil not only because he kill without hesitation but also because he is lying bastard nright from the first five minute of the film de palma ha created hatred towards capone and he show that this man must be brought down at all cost nthis developed hatred is before the film hero ness is even introduced ni found this approach to be very clever because in small duration of time there is great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone nthe film only get better from this point nwith the formation of the untouchable there is group of men wearing long dark overcoat and hat nthey walk in unison and they only look forward na they walk down the street they are observed and feared by citizen nholding shot gun and pistol in their hand to stop criminal this image of vigilante must have influenced future film none that come to mind is the matrix when neo morpheus trinity and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world nwearing more futuristic outfit of the same 1930 style the similarity between these two are countless the untouchable ha some of the hippest bravest hero in any action film nthe four member were the only one willing to go against capone army neach member of this special group also had their own characteristic that separated them from others nelliot ness played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner is character that surely grows during the course of the film nhe begin a man who is determined to follow all law no matter how unfair they may be nhowever a the film develops so doe ness nhis belief involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually member of the other side nhe also begin to lose his stability when his adversary begin to murder his friend nhis anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in nsean connery who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role play malone an aging cop who decides to make one final run a member of the untouchable nmalone act a mentor to ness nhe teach him the chicago way to do thing when they attack with knife you attack with gun nconnery play his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed nandy garcia doe wonderful job a george stone young man who is just becoming police officer na ness grows he begin to teach stone some valuable lesson that malone once taught him ncharles martin smith is also fantastic a the final member who attempt to use an income tax offense against capone nsmith is perfect for his role a he add some valuable comic relief to the film nthe action scene are also some of the most beautifully choreographed have ever seen nalso very similar to the matrix they are exciting and intense from western like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station step the scene are well thought out and well executed nthe score during these scene ingeniously add to the excitement nit pounding drum beat act a rhythm for the actor nthe combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective nalthough the real life untouchable may have been excessively glorified this film is pure entertainment and contains unique blend of great acting great directing and great action nsome scene capone and the baseball bat the train station have stuck in my mind for year and seeing them again will only make them more vivid', 'you ve got mail work alot better than it deserves to nin order to make the film success all they had to do wa cast two extremely popular and attractive star have them share the screen for about two hour and then collect the profit nno real acting wa involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it body it basically complete re shoot of the shop around the corner only adding few modern twist nessentially it go against and defies all concept of good contemporary filmmaking nit overly sentimental and at time terribly mushy not to mention very manipulative nbut oh how enjoyable that manipulation is nbut there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that make the movie work a well a it doe because absolutely hated the previous ryan hank teaming sleepless in seattle nit couldn have been the directing because both film were helmed by the same woman ni haven quite yet figured out what liked so much about you ve got mail but then again is that really important nif you like something so much why even question it nagain the storyline is a cliched a they come ntom hank play joe fox the insanely likeable owner of discount book chain and meg ryan play kathleen kelley the even more insanely likeable proprietor of family run child book shop called in nice homage the shop around the corner nfox and kelley soon become bitter rival because the new fox book store is opening up right across the block from the small business nlittle do they know they are already in love with each other over the internet only neither party know the other person true identity nthe rest of the story isn important because all it doe is serve a mere backdrop for the two star to share the screen nsure there are some mildly interesting subplots but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship nall of this of course lead up to the predictable climax nbut a foreseeable a the ending is it so damn cute and well done that doubt any movie in the entire year contains scene the evokes a much pure joy a this part doe nwhen ryan discovers the true identity of her online love wa filled with such for lack of better word happiness that for the first time all year actually left the theater smiling', 'if there one thing in common about all of hollywood major studio it that their production are moving toward mainstream more and more nalthough twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiary which specialize in independant or controversial motion picture fox searchlight and fine line respectively it obvious there no significant movement underway to promote inventive idea at the theater nso when movie like gary ross pleasantville come along wrapped in blanket of innovative idea and served up on platter of fine production it a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes nalthough the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted pleasantville should not be mistaken for no thought movie nquite the opposite is true in fact a director ross skillfully brings narrative with intense and intelligent undertone to the screen nthe story both about the joy of living life to the fullest a well a the social ill of segregation capture the essence of statement making in the cinema nnot in recent memory ha movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution and even if mass audience fail to see the ingenuity of ross work it is still testament that his picture wa considered worthy enough nkudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture nit star tobey maguire and reese witherspoon a two ninety teenager who through quite bit of luck find themselves zapped into fifty sitcom named pleasantville nmaguire a the reserved bud parker is perfect for the pseudo world but the rebellious mary sue witherspoon is not at all made for the father know best time nit not long before she set the town of pleasantville on end and begin to teach the townspeople in quite unlikely way what life is really like nsoon hue of color creep into the black and white world and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism others fear the strangeness nat one end is soda shop owner turned painter named mr johnson jeff daniel and at the other end is close minded mayor t nwalsh and his chamber of commerce but the two side are simply front for clash of idea that soon involves the entire town nfine performance are turned in all around nmaguire and witherspoon are effective a the lead but the true complement go out to jeff daniel and t nwalsh in his latest and final posthumous performance ndaniels brings an atmosphere of awe inspiration and hope to his character whereas walsh simply drip of sinister closemindedness almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman envy nfor daniel it his most commendable performance of the last three year or more and for walsh it a complementary exclamation point on fine career nalso of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen and in viewing the entire cast work well together from start to finish nthere not much to dislike about pleasantville and it dynamic nature make it the perfect movie for those who want serious a well a those who don n', 'fully loaded entertainment review website coming in july from ace ventura to truman burbank jim carrey ha run the whole gamut of comic yet sympathetic character n1996 the cable guy wa supposed to be his big breakthrough role from zany humor into darker more dramatic acting na most everyone know the result were well le than stellar nnot only did the film not do so hot at the box office but it wa also panned by critic na far a know gene siskel and are the only one willing to admit that we dug it nthe first time saw the cable guy in theatre wa in super critic mode and didn really like it nhowever due to the fact that hbo show the movie every single day ve had time to lean back relax and take in the film nand to my surprise it grew on me nthe plot is rather simple broderick play guy named steven who befriends his cable guy played by carrey then is stalked by him when steven try to break off the relationship nsee steven been having some problem with his girlfriend robin leslie mann and he doesn think he ha any more room in his life for new friend nalso some of the cable guy antic have been creeping him out ncarrey a the cable guy give steven various alias which later we find out are all tv character larry tate chip douglas ricky ricardo etc he apparently life in his cable van and while many critic didn enjoy this newer darker le manic performance from carrey thought it wa interesting and rather well done nfor me it not the movie a whole that enjoyable but rather several individual scene karaoke jam at steven apartment medieval fight at theme restaurant and bathroom beating la liar liar just to name few nperhaps the fact that more of carrey humorous side come out during these scene is what make them so funny nand if you really want to see something you ve got to hear his version of jefferson airplane somebody to love sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam nthe cable guy ha it bad spot like most any movie ni didn particularly like steven girlfriend and felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend nalso the ending while having you fooled for moment is rather contrived and somewhat dissapointing nstill found the cable guy to be worthwhile venture if you re at the video store and can think of anything to rent suggest you try it out nor if you have hbo just wait till it come on you won have to wait long nhell that what do every day', 'movie like mortal kombat annihilation work and must be reviewed on multiple level nfirst there the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie nbut occasionaly almost a if making an ironic self depreciating remark the movie toss in clearly marxist imagery nno no njust kidding nhad you going there for moment didn i nin all seriousness however and to be fair to the movie it is necessary to provide two viewpoint that of movie watcher unfamiliar or only marginally familiar with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon and that of fan of the first movie and or fan of the game nthe first movie mortal kombat 1995 concerned itself with martial art tournament that would decide the fate of earth and it 5 billion inhabitant nthe mortal won and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth nunfortunately shao khan wa poor loser and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway ready to take over the planet a our hero assumed fighting stance nthe first movie wa extraordinarily entertaining for those like myself who are fan of the game ni even go so far a to say that many folk who didn know about the game probably enjoyed the movie nthe writer and director knew the limitation of both their cast and of the basic story itself and they didn try to overachieve nthere were lot of really cool fight scene with really cool accompanying music intersperesed with some distracting but ultimately non intrusive bit of fluff passing itself off a plot nand a we know the movie wa smashing success at the box office nmortal kombat annihilation pick up precisely where that movie left off with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie nshao khan ha decided that he going to take over the earth anyways and to hell with some silly rule about mortal winning the tournament nthereafter follows approximately 85 minute of film that alternate between being confused being trite being silly and being just plain stupid none get the general impression that the producer of the movie thought hey that last movie wa such success that we can get more money and make real movie now ntoo bad they didn simply stick with the formula from the first movie ni could write volume about the thing that are wrong with this picture but here are the high point the acting is truly bad nsandra hess playing the sonya blade character is particularly execrable especially in scene where she try to convince u that she loved johnny cage character from the first movie who get greased at the beginning of this movie in one of the worst piece of mi casting think ve ever seen james remar play raiden the god of thunder nin the first movie christopher lambert played raiden and played his character a though he wa in on the joke french actor playing japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystic ni generally like it when actor are cast against type tim tiny lister jr being cast a the president of the s in the fifth element for example and remar ha always been one of my favorite utility actor but he so totally wrong for this part that he doesn even have the luxury of amused self awareness there are too many character that are introduced a being potentially important but then never seen again there are number of completely meaningless story sidetrack including muddled scene where liu kang robin shou seek out nightwolf litefoot ha mystical hallucination and then wanders off with jade irina pantaeva nfor these reason and many others can only give the movie 2 unless you re huge fan of the game and or the first movie nin that case the following critique also apply sandra hess while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson who played sonya blade in the first movie is much more convincing a fighter nwilson looked like she wa simply mimicing some movement taught to her by the fight choreographer nhess look like she actually know some martial art and put together much more believable fight scene in the fight each of the character doe at least one thing they do in the game and often more nsonya doe her kiss of death jax doe his earthquake liu kang doe his animality and so on na big bonus for those of u who were looking for similar move in the first movie and found them only rarely there aren a many fight scene in this movie a there were in the first because the folk making the movie mistakenly try to hang more robust plot in between nsilly silly folk nand the lamest fight involved two of the woman in what turn into mud wrestling match nlame and so obviously sexist even politically incorrect for the most part noticed and remarked upon it the special effect are generally better except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their animality nmotaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro wa in the first movie nfor folk like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the game give this 5 nyou ll probably like it but not nearly a much a you liked the first one', 'that exactly how long the movie felt to me nthere weren even nine laugh in nine month nit a terrible mess of movie starring terrible mess of man mr hugh grant huge dork nit not the whole oral sex prostitution thing referring to grant not me that bug me it the fact that grant is annoying nnot just adam sandler annoying we re talking jim carrey annoying nsince when do eye flutter and nervous smile pas for acting nbut on the other hand since when do really bad slapstick fistfight in the delivery room culminating in grant head in joan cusack lap scene he paid 60 to have included in the movie and obscene double entendres robin williams the obstetrician tell grant pregnant girlfriend she ha big pussy referring of course to the size of the cat hair on her coat but nonetheless grant paid 60 to have the exchange included in the movie pas for comedy nnine month is predictable cookie cutter movie with no originality in humor or plot nhugh grant play successful child psychiatrist nwhy child psychologist nso the scriptwriter could inject the following unfunny exchange nkid my dad an asshole ngrant flutter eyelash offer nervous smile then responds in his annoying english accent and think actually have talent attitude could you possibly elaborate on that nkid my dad a _huge_ asshole nmore like hugh asshole but that beside the point which is nine month includes too many needlessly stupid joke that get laugh from the ten year old in the audience while everyone else shake his or her head in disbelief nso anyway grant find out his girlfriend is pregnant and doe his usual reaction fluttered eyelash nervous smile nthis pave the way for every possible pregnancy child birth gag in the book especially since grant equally annoying friend wife is also pregnant nthe annoying friend is played by tom arnold who provides most of the cacophonous slapstick none of which is funny such a scene where arnold beat up costumed arnie the dinosaur you draw your own parallel on that one in toy store nthe only interesting character in the movie is played by jeff goldblum who should have hid himself away somewhere after the dreadful hideaway a an artist with fear of and simultaneous longing for commitment nnot even robin williams who play russian doctor who ha recently decided to switch from veterinary medicine to obstetrics ha much humor nhis is one joke character the old foreign guy who mispronounces english stereotype did someone say yakov smirnov nthat my favorite vodka by the way hence the line now it time to take look at your volvo another nasty but unamusing joke except this one go right over the ten year old head while the adult simultaneously groan nnine month is complete failure low on laugh and intelligence and high on loud unfunny slapstick failed joke and other uninspired lunacy nhugh grant sunset boulevard arrest please no caught with his pant down joke may bring more people into the theater but they certainly won leave with smile on their face not after 90 minute of grant nervous smile neverything in the movie is so forced so unauthentic that anyone with an q nover 80 sorry hugh will know they wasted their money on an unfulfilled desire nbut at least they didn spend 60 buck for it', 'play it to the bone the newest addition to ron shelton sport themed repertoire fails in numerous way nlike most of shelton other great film bull durham white men can jump this dud unsuccessfully attempt to use athleticism a method of connecting character and creating interesting subplots nshelton film are not considered sport film but they do heavily revolve around specific game to tell story nshelton ha been so good in the past at using sport to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of film we are given an examination of different class and race living in various different region nplay it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull but the side story of the two guy and girl travelling across the country is even worse nthe film ha no social message like it predecessor nthe relationship between the friend two failed boxer who must face off against each other in the ring for 50 thousand dollar is very confusing for number of reason nthe whole film since it is primarily buddy picture depends on the strength of the friendship the two character have for each other nunfortunately it is very weak bond for the reason listed below n1 we never see how cesar antonio banderas and vince woody harrelson meet nthe two are so different from each other that scene of how this odd friendship developed should have been mandatory n2 vince and cesar argue every moment possible on their trip to la vega nthere is not one convincing moment dedicated to seeing the character laugh together or actually agree on something n3 the third character on the trip grace lolita davidovich stand in the way nshe is in nearly every scene with them making it impossible to understand the difficulty the two male character are going to have when they fight each other n4 there are two many interfering irrelevant side story nvince is convinced that he see jesus on regular basis cesar yell at the sky in spanish when he is angry and grace try to sell her invention to hotel owner robert wagner nthese boring tale only hurt the central plot n5 when it come to time for the two men to fight they don even hesitate to pound each other nwasn the whole point of the road trip to show that these two are friend who could never hurt each other nby the time the road trip part of the movie is over with the film want to be over nshelton on the other hand continues to tell his story nforty five painful minute remain nthe boxing scene between cesar and vince start out very powerful and interestingly different from other boxing movie nhowever the fight go on for way too long and becomes very repetitive and predictable after awhile kind of like the whole film', 'knock off is exactly that cheap knock off of an action movie nit also the worst movie have seen thus far this year ni figured it would be at least couple of month before saw the worst film of 1998 but ala it ha already been found njean claude van damme star a think designer jean executive who discovers his half brother ha been supplying him with cheaper good nrob schneider play van damme partner and rochon play nactually have no idea who rochon wa supposed to be nshe just sort of popped up halfway through without an explanation a to why she wa there nmany thing are not explained in this film but do know that for some bizarre reason van damme seemed to be doing jackie chan impression throughout the flick nwhere chan come off a endearing in his normal guy character seen in many of his film van damme just come off a wimp nwe re never given any clear explanation a to the basis for many of his action nto be more clear did not even know who he wa supposed to be until about an hour into the movie and even then it wa not made too clear nthe film ha been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong ntsui hark who directed van damme last movie the bad but not nearly a bad a this double team never let the camera rest for second and that no exaggeration nwe are even treated to five second shot from the point of view of van damme foot entering shoe nfabulous nseriously though have no problem with director who want to play around with film convention a long a they don get carried away nfor example look at sam raimi army of darkness one of his best movie feature some of the most inventive camera work have ever seen but raimi never let the special effect get in the way of story nthat a concept that tsui can seem to grasp nthe special effect and outrageous camera angle rule knock off to the point where the audience doesn have clue a to what happening any more nanother problem with the film is that it look cheap nthe film stock used is of such low caliber that thought wa watching one of those chinese film shown really late at night nand for some inexplicable reason everyone voice seems to have been dubbed neven the star nand even the special effect seemingly the only aspect of the film the director actually cared about are inconsistent nfor example there is scene in which van damme drive car out of window nthe car slam into the ground and the left wheel is completely destroyed nseconds later the car drive off at full speed nhey have no problem suspending my disbelief in an action movie but line must be drawn somewhere nfinally the acting nnobody give good performance in this film nvan damme an actor usually like is way off the mark playing everyman nand schneider here to provide comic relief assume is totally unfunny and over act his way through every scene neven the usually solid paul sorvino give terribly over the top performance a nonce again have no idea who he wa supposed to be nin case haven yet made it clear enough knock off is the worst movie of van damme career and possibly the worst movie of the decade nand it not even one of those movie that so bad it funny nit too inept to be funny nthere are no redeeming factor in knock off and seriously hope that every print of this film is burned to crisp and that somehow my memory of watching the film can be erased', 'forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the

arthur miller name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen adaptation of his play nthis is far from harmless event bad start to an already shaky morality tale nthe play describes the film opening scene during tense exchange that make one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply and this add to the play charged atmosphere nin the film the opening scene becomes an unintentional pandora box nnot only is credulity stretched but abigail obsession is unfortunately spotlighted nit position the crucible more a cautionary fable about obsessive

jerry andrew ross ha the hots for cute blonde kerry brennan and there is big contest in the climax nhow fun nsince party camp ha practically no screenplay and there is no talent at all involved the least the maker could have done wa make it raunchy and exploitative nit not that think exploitation is necessarily good quality but when you are talking about dull turkey like this the least that could have been done would be to fill it with lot of mindless sex neven psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick nat least then it wouldn have been such chore to sit through nnever

hundred likely thousand or even million of other angel spends eternity watching over the citizen of mortality human never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life nmeg ryan in her most subdued performance yet play maggie doctor who begin to ponder exactly who it is we re fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive nafter losing patient on the surgery table these

themselves seen to anyone they desire nseth adoration is too much to resist and eventually he doe appear to maggie quite regularly although such thing seems taboo among the angelic community nthe angel are interestingly presented all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitman than traditional glowing white entity but it a nice touch that never seems like mere attempt at uniqueness

nit nice to see ryan pick up role like this and the one in courage under fire nthe two aren very comparable to each other but they both deviate from her usual intelligently ditzy romantic comedy role

out there they just didn know quite how to get to it nthey struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high nfilmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on remember and convey to others thru word of mouth so after telling u for 60 minute that this film is glorious masterpiece they sure leave u with disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouth nbased on the german film wing of desire that being the english title of course city of angel is ninety percent success enough to make most people forgive it shortcoming even the devastatingly disappointing ending nmost movie goer the non cynic anyway will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which need to be criticized

medieval sexist mold and prove her worth a fighter on arthur side quest for camelot is missing pure showmanship an essential element if it ever expected to climb to the high rank of disney nthere nothing here that differentiates quest from something you see on any given saturday morning cartoon subpar animation instantly forgettable song poorly integrated computerized footage compare kayley and garrett run in with the angry ogre to herc battle with the hydra ni rest my case neven the character stink none of them are remotely interesting so much that the film becomes race to see which one

be thrilled to find jaleel urkel white and bronson balki pinchot sharing the same footage na few scene are nicely realized though m at loss to recall enough to be specific and the actor providing the voice talent are enthusiastic though most are paired up with singer who don sound thing like them for their big musical moment jane seymour and celine dion nbut one must strain through too much of

sidetracked by it own story that is never resolved and end with very anticlimaxic epilogue nin way this is typical hollywood sequel nmore money ha been spent and more people have worked on project that wa doomed to fail nthe horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated nof course in these situation quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical value nfrom it opening scene when the camera gracefully pane over the bloody red forest with carter burwell being john malkovich and fargo musical score in the background you realize that with the exception of it title this film ha absolutely nothing to do with the blair witch project blair witch nwas filmed by handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting that wa mostly based on improvisation nin the sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection creating completely different atmosphere nwith it graceful cinematography production design and flashy editing the film ha very polished look which is impossible to associate with the first installment nand though berlinger directs his film with an energy and pace that make the adrenaline rush through the body couple of time he ha obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor nthe key is simplicity blair witch project had story which wa incredibly simple nthat allowed the audience to fill the gap with our own imagination nthe film wa practically an empty screen on which we projected our most frightening nightmare nthe effect wa incredibly powerful lasting and entir everyone but in different way book of shadow feel incredibly controlled and restrict nhere very little is left to our imagination and the story is so complex and clever that the screenwriter are the first to get lost in it nthere is is no book of shadow and no conclusion that we can be satisfied with nthis is simply le artistic film that doesn have the talent and originality of it predecessor nit resort to fancy cinematography and special effect to create the right effect and doesn always succeed nbut most importantly it stand on it own ground and ha almost no connection with the first movie which doesn allow it to destroy the original nin the end can call it bad effort nit le artistic not so scary and le original but certainly not bad nit simply different nin fact if you haven seen the blair witch project you might like this film for what it is cross between the blair witch project and the scream film nthe only element that remains constant and similar between the two film is the solid acting jeffrey donovan and tristine skyler should be mentioned and incredible sense of surrealism nbut it a common knowledge and experience that with few exception every movie sequel is worse than the original and some are even not worth making nto me the story of the blair witch project seemed completed but there are obviously no limit to commercial success that the book of shadow is certainly assured nand it already time to look forward to blair witch 3', 'when it come to the average teenage romantic comedy expect negative review from critic left and right npredictable unoriginal and forgettable will most

without having that nagging feeling of attraction for each other nwith advice from their roommate amanda detmer jason biggs ryan and jennifer attempt to discover the true meaning of their relationship nthe film definitely life up to the dreaded three adjective and mindless entertainment is nowhere to be found ni could hardly sit through the 93 minute running time for several reason nthe dialogue is probably the worst have ever seen in any movie mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring script and the ridiculous word these character use is what hollywood think kid can relate to nit is almost offensive nan example of an insightful conversation you re dumb ndumb dumb dumb dumb no followed by mandy moore esque tune background well it not a bad a wing commander guess nthe supporting cast is also painfully useless ndetmer and biggs stand in the way for anything interesting to happen with their own boring pointless subplots nand although this is supposed to be from both perspective of the human sex prinze jr ryan dominates the screen while forlani jennifer simply act a dilemma for him to work with nwe never learn anything about jennifer which is shame too because forlani is the only actor to bring any life into her character nteenager or not you ll hate this movie guarantee it nmaybe should rent she all that again ni it really a good a think it is', 'sydney lumet is the

even more complicated when she develops feeling for young cabalistic scholar ariel eric thal nusing peter weir formula isn the greatest flaw of this film neven the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot work to the certain extent nbut the worst insult to viewer audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith nthe author of this review never liked this actress very much but she wa at least tolerable in some of her role nrole of emily eden unfortunately isn one of them nfirst of all she can pas for tough nypd street fighter and her attempt to pas for orthodox jewish woman isn much better nscreenplay by robert avrech make thing even worse with some formulaic red herring subplots scene involving two italian gangster wa almost too painful to watch nbut on the other hand other actor are more convincing lee richardson a an old rabbi thal a ariel and charming mia sara a his intended bride and the photography by andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth when the scene take place in hassidic community nalso the film might educate viewer about hassidic culture nthat is the only thing that prevents it from turning into total waste of time', 'so ask yourself what

young anakin skywalker nif you ve read any review you ve also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy nyou also may have heard that this one too kiddie friendly and doesn have enough content for adult nbelieve the hype nthe effect are stunning the digitalized creature are amazingly realistic the lightsaber duel are amazing and queen amidala sumptuous robe are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth nbut there something missing here and it isn budget or effect it everything money can buy nthe actor struggle a best they can to flesh out broad stroked and flat character nthe most successful at this is liam neeson who a qui gon jinni jedi master to young obi wan kenobi ha quiet dignity and wise commanding presence nhe is the anchor to this movie a he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out nportman queen amidala and mcgregor obi wan kenobi don fare nearly so well namidala the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation come off a stoic stilted and caricatured it appears a though she wa vulcan geisha in former life nand obi wan although mcgregor make him very endearing ha so little screen time that he nothing but robin to qui gon jinni batman nhowever mcgregor doe struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with spark of genuine insight and humanity and he doe good job nhe also absolutely nail alec guiness obi wan in episode 4 6 scottish accent and that really make his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise nin fact lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite bit and that one of the problem with this film ni would never call myself star war fan especially not considering what it mean to be fanatic these day but ve always enjoyed the film along with everyone else in america nhowever if you are the one person in america who hasn seen the film at all or even recently or who doesn bother to brush up on the name of obscure character you may be hopelessly lost nfor example one of the film main nefarious character is senator palpatine nfor those of you not recently steeped in star war trivia emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who wa darth vader master in return of the jedi and empire strike back nso obviously his appearance in phantom menace is meant to stir some echo of his later role in the series thus making his role here more meaningful na lot of the movie is like that nr2 d2 and 3po make token appearance and it obvious that lucas is banking on the audience pre existing fondness for them nbecause he doesn do much to add to it in any way nsame go for jabba the hutt who doesn look a much mean here a he doe corpulent and lazy neven planet make foreshadowing guest appearance in this film tatooine the desert world where luke grew up coruscant the cloud city from empire strike back and alderaan leia home planet which we never actually see that get blown up in star war show up or are mentioned briefly in passing nwhat the result of tying so many plot point and character to future film nthe answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty nthere no meat no substance that make you want to love the character a they are not a they will be nanother problem is that there are actually too many alien character in the film ni wa distracted by the fact that two of the main evil character strange looking alien who looked like gila monster had mouth that barely moved making them look more like muppets than actual character nand jar jar binks silly roger rabbitish amphibious character is intended a comic relief but what he really becomes is annoying and fast nunlike chewbacca and 3po who got their humanity if you ll pardon the expression from their interaction with the human character jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind at time making the movie seem like nothing more than very expensive teenage mutant ninja turtle nfurthermore the dialogue is often stilted and corny and sometimes downright infantile thereby rendering some character into nothing more than bystander to the plot noddly this isn just my judgment lucas ha said that he designed this film for kid nwell he done good job nthe hero of this film of course is young anakin but it wa very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight year old boy nthat not jake lloyd fault though he doe good job of being cute kid which is apparently all lucas asked of him nthat another mistake of course because the cute tyke becomes darth vader nwarning spoiler ahead nin my opinion there wa not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin future evil in the film nthe boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheek and there nothing more than spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie nhe ha doting mother pernilla august making her first english language film and is slave to gross flying gnome on tatooine nbut the only indication the audience get that this kid isn all heart and rose is yoda hesitation in allowing him to train a jedi under qui gon jinni nhis explanation his future is clouded warning major spoiler ahead nenter at your own risk nof course the noble qui gon dy at the hand of darth maul scary looking sith lord who excels at the jedi art but ha turned to the dark side nthis dude ha maybe two line in the entire movie but he establishes his presence through his amazing move with his double sided lightsaber and his scary facial makeup nbecause qui gon never get chance to train the young anakin in the way of the force obi wan qui gon young padawan apprentice one level below knightdom must take over the training himself nso at the end of the movie we end where the saga actually begin with obi wan kenobi and his young apprentice anakin darth vader skywalker ndid this story need to be told ni would say no nbut is it worthwhile movie to see nabsolutely nif you don enter the theater with jedi size expectation and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle then this is your movie nthe tatooine pod race are triumph of effect and computer animation nthe digitalized background on some of the planet are an astonishing sight nand yoda and young obi wan are worth seeing for their origin in simpler happier time nabove all this is fun movie nnot deep not meaningful and not profound nbut fun nmaybe next time lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co write the script and the guy who directed empire will direct nbecause if lucas doe the next one himself it will be lacking the one thing it need the most potential n', 'seen may 31 1999 on home video rented none of the best thing about the movie is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze thing in your own everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise nwith some film it might be just secondary issue but with dark city what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are which is poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in movie nthere an old role playing computer game called ja wherein the player take on the role of man who can remember who he is where he is and how he got there nthe goal is to gather a many clue a possible to figure that out and along the way overcome conflict nthe premise to this film is not unlike that game only this time we don have control over the protagonist nwe begin by meeting seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city actually it more than just the city it the whole reality that isn just that neo gothic look la batman blade runner but is so fully developed it almost different genre completely nlater he will learn that his name is john murdoch sewell but for now he ha no idea what going on other than the fact something is not right nthe fact there a dead body in the corner go to enhance the feeling of paranoia and mysterious hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling nthis opening scene alone go long way to define the setting of the film and it bizarre horrific tone nthe man doesn know who he is nor where he going and it interesting to follow him since we the viewer have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him nin fact this is the way all story begin since it impossible to know the history of character their feeling value moral etc until after we ve observed them for while nbut in this case the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization developing the mood and outlining the story neventually some semblance of plot begin to unfold a it appears that john is serial killer wanted by the police nwe met inspector frank bumstead hurt quiet unemotional soft spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time ntwo other important character are also introduced dr daniel schreber sutherland neurotic psychiatrist who claim to be john doctor and emma murdoch connelly jazz singer dolled up to look like caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serial or any given leading lady of the old film noir movie nit wa schreber who contacted john for reason that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film nhe also contact emma which further help the film reveal what is seemingly complex mysterious back story nbut absolutely nothing is a it appears to be in dark city which is what make it so fascinating throughout it continual scene of confusion and vertigo neverything the filmmaker want u to see ha some significance considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot it lighting art direction and overall production design they don seem to be able to afford any gratuity nhowever that might also be what keeping it from reaching it maximum potential nby continuing to follow john a he wanders around this strange place so much unlike the real world we know we come to realize that it all hoax neveryone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by race of alien to understand what make human tick in their effort to somehow save themselves from extinction nbut a the film tagline say last night one of u went off nfor reason that are never clearly explained it appears that john posse telekinetic power to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive process known a tuning nthe alien which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin also posse the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight nat the same time all the human fall asleep and after the change are made they awake and either continue where they left off or begin new life they have no idea they did not have until then nthis premise certainly is interesting and director and co screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard nhe doe provide some explanation such a that dr schreber is an assistant to the stranger because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form nthe alien mix and match the memory of the city population to see who will change and who will not nin the process this creates for good deal of deep thought provoking philosophy that could be applied to the real world nhowever where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart a to what make person who he or she is nthe main character are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotion it come off a distant static and cold mediocre performance by hurt and connelly don help either nfor example john realizes emma is not and probably never wa his wife so he doe not feel an emotional bond to her yet in some scene crucial to the film plot we are expected to believe they do have genuine love for each other which is also part of the film climax and ending nand that what proyas seems to be inferring with the film but never quite manages to convey in it fullest sense nironically this is what made his first film the crow work so well which had similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within nearly identical dark twisted world nwith dark city the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message nstill the film is by no mean bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable nthere a lot to like here most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which account for at least half the reason the film is able to tell the story it doe nthe story a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in year dark city is what the movie are all about the escape from the real world', 'the american action film ha been slowly drowning to death in sea of asian wire fu copycat nit not pretty death and it

since drunken master 2 at time fighting style especially that of monkey himself do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle toed floating of film like crouching tiger hidden dragon director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scene back to earth niron monkey is at it heart hardcore kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama la crouching tiger nhowever there are brief moment of profoundness shared between character such a those that pas between our outlaw hero and his good hearted but misguided enemy chief fox nin those moment and in others iron monkey manages to transcend it mindless kung fu nature to touch the heart and mind of it audience nwhile in no way the equal of masterpiece like drunken master 2 iron monkey dance quite nicely to the invading kung fu

murphy oliver platt ha written him speech to feed to group of black people in church in the ghetto bulworth begin the speech but suddenly go off track and just start being honest you mean one lady asks the democratic party doesn care about the african american community well he shout laughing isn that obvious nthe story is propelled by device in which bulworth put out contract on his own life he mus later that it a bad thing to make decision when you re suicidal he keep seeing man in sunglass graham beckel whom he belief to be the hitman bulworth also meet nina halle berry with whom he becomes infatuated suddenly in the short span of this weekend bulworth no nonsense truth in politics method become national sensation and he shoot ahead in the poll despite the fact that he appearing on television wearing gang clothes and spewing more profanity than coherent sentence nbeatty work on both side of the camera is excellent nhis script and direction are both extremely sharp a is the surprisingly strong characterization of bulworth himself nhere is man who reached his limit and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political structure ni like that the film doesn take clear shot at any of the political party or affiliation but at politics in general and how everything is run by the rich although the anti rich sentiment do get bit tiresome by the end of the film nsome of the segment are simply hilarious such a lengthy rap that he delivers at luncheon dedicated to him nmuch of the film is completely absurd but that the fun part about it nit an angry serious film at the core but the package that beatty ha created is so much more accessible than recent attempt in the genre nwhat add to this feeling is beatty portrayal of bulworth this is performance that deserves recognition on higher scale beatty is so much fun to watch here he always funny but he also subtle in way that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable action beatty is so good that bulworth despite his shortcoming a human being is an entirely sympathetic and likable character almost from the beginning nthe supporting cast is vast and colorful nberry is luminous a always and add to her repertoire of solid supporting role ndon cheadle ha good role a drug dealer who us gun toting toddler to do his dirty work noliver platt is an actor who should be careful for someday fear he may induce heart attack with the intensity of his acting though he very funny to watch paul sorvino add the southern accent to his list of mastered inflection ni bulworth offensive ni suppose some may see it that way ni wasn offended by the film but then again hardly care about politics ni think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of the story nthe film isn perfect of course the ending didn quite work for me and the few of the scene between bulworth and nina feel forced although the eclectic dance sequence is fantastic nbut these are minor quibble about an otherwise brilliant film nbulworth is smart uproariously funny picture that prof to me that political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface', 'call 911

find themselves suspect in the murder of drug dealer and on the run from nasty thug vondie curtis hall nin order for you to buy into gridlock at all you have to accept it a surreal odyssey rather than a urban realism unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie they are going to government office on new year day in which case they should be thankful

stretch with the question do you expect the world to stop just nbecause you picked _today_ to clean up nthe world in gridlock is just a frustrating a the world in falling down but the cathartic moment yield no easy answer this time nhall ha some interesting thing to say about what we expect from the system but perhaps not enough of them na significant chunk of gridlock is devoted to spoon and stretch flight from reper and from the police and those sub plot serve up some thoroughly predictable moment nin one scene stretch scare off reper by getting chummy with police officer another present that old chestnut of the two mistakenly suspected hero in public place watching television news report of the crime which show their picture nthe entire sequence of event seems designed merely a an excuse to get spoon and stretch running while the other primary plot ha them standing in line or sitting down much of the time nhall also play with gratuitous insert of drug paraphernalia and flashback to the day before the film main event perhaps making particular effort to point out the talent the character are wasting through self destructive behavior noh the irony of it ntupac shakur made career in music and movie playing the hard case and living the life to back it up nin gridlock shakur get the chance to play someone who ha seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scare him nspoon is an idea for character at best a written by hall but shakur display an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction nmostly it come through those eye eye

video ntheir proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they re typically inexpensive to produce no special effect no big name star and serve a vehicle to flash nudity allowing them to frequent late night cable television nstalked waver slightly from the norm in one respect the psycho never actually ha an affair on the contrary he rejected rather quickly the psycho typically is an ex lover ex wife or ex husband nother than that stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelf and viewed after midnight on cable nstalked doe not provide much suspense though that is what it set out to do ninterspersed throughout the opening credit for instance serious sounding narrator spout statistic about stalker and ponders what may cause man to stalk it implicitly implied that all stalker are men while picture of boy are shown on the screen nafter these credit snapshot of actor jay underwood appears nthe narrator state that this is the story of daryl gleason

joker ha to shoot the downed vc sniper a near pornographic eternity ni didn agree with that assessment but could see what wa being implied the reviewer felt a if the audience wa being incited to stand up and pump their fist and shout do er man do er nthat sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship trooper nit literally like giant recruitment film that ha gone berserk nit try frantically to

counterattack humankind doe the single stupidest thing imaginable instead of nuke the planet from orbit which they re clearly capable of they send down grunt with 16 rifle nthis isn heinlein it a bad wwii movie one where all the most obvious point of satire are ever poked and prodded in combat scene that are noisy repetitive and ultimately tiresome one scene ha journalist on battlefield filimg soldier being slaughtered and end with groaning predictability said cameraman get skewered too nthe soldier and their commander are consistently idiotic nthey do not posse germ of tactical intelligence or even common sense nthey don even behave like soldier in bad movie and therefore we don care about them nwe hated the tom berenger character in platoon but he mattered and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate nhere we don even hate the bug what there to hate nhating them would be like cursing hurricaine nif there anything really hateful there the movie doesn know how to

it worn out it welcome nthere never any sense that these people are really thinking their way out of anything or really being tested to show their mettle nalso the movie is irritatingly selective with how effective the bug are to earthling weaponry nif bug ha one of the human screaming in it grasp then five guy can stand around it and blast away on full auto without doing damned thing nbut if one human get cornered he lay waste to whole platoon of bug with one clip nuh huh nthe very worst feature of the movie is it repulsive quasi fascist flavor ni say quasi because while the movie us many of the trapping of fascism ot eroticize it action the gear the uniform etc the movie doesn have the nerve or the brain to be genuinely fascist or intelligent about the subject nthe bumper between scene which are apparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propaganda are propaganda just so clumsy and oafish that they wind up making the bug look relatively innocuous in comparison nlike the rest

in which people fight something horrible are the same a horror scene nfor writer and director of horror film supposedly an expert on horror it is very bad mistake to make nghosts of mar is called horror movie but it is more just drawn out fight between human and surprisingly low powered alien menace nin addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghost of mar carpenter would have ground to sue nthis film is just chock full of piece taken from assault on precinct 13 the thing and prince of darkness nit is in fact surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many piece of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way nbut that still doe not make for really good science fiction experience nghosts of mar take place in the year 2176 nmars ha been mostly terraformed so that human can walk on the surface without breathing gear which is good for the film budget nit is never mentioned but the gravity on mar ha been increased somehow to earth normal again making it easier to film nsociety ha changed bit by that time but it ha advanced surprisingly little napparently the culture ha changed so that woman are much more in position of control nand from carpenter view woman have really made mess of thing nsociety ha stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advance society ha changed le in 175 year than we might expect it to change

colony ninstead of having the criminal napolean wilson this film ha the criminal desolation williams ninstead of facing hoodlum with automatic weapon the police face well ghost of mar nbecause the ghost are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner but they essentially behave a human savage in another lapse of imagination nthe story is told in flashback flashback within flashback and flashback within flashback within flashback nghosts of mar take place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tone of red yellow and black ncarpenter manages to give u

review an even harder one to write since generally applaud film which attempt to break the mold mess with your head and such lost highway memento but there are good and bad way of making all type of film and these folk just didn snag this one correctly nthey seem to have taken this pretty neat concept but executed it terribly nso what are the problem with the movie nwell it main problem is that it simply too jumbled nit start off normal but then downshift into this fantasy world in which you a an audience member have no idea what going on nthere are dream there are character coming back from the dead there are others who look like the dead there are strange apparition there are disappearance there are looooot of chase scene there are ton of weird thing that happen and most of it is simply not explained nnow personally don mind trying to unravel film every now and then but when all it doe is give me the same clue over and over again get kind of fed up after while which is this film biggest problem nit obviously got this big secret to hide but it seems to want to hide it completely until it final five minute nand do they make thing entertaining thrilling or even engaging in the meantime nnot really nthe sad part is that the arrow and both dig on flick like this so we actually figured most of it out by the half way point so all of the strangeness after that did start to make little bit of sense but it still didn the make the film all that more entertaining ni guess the bottom line with movie like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is into it even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding ni mean showing melissa sagemiller running away from vision for about 20 minute throughout the movie is just plain lazy nokay we get it there nare people chasing her and we don know who they are ndo we really need to see it over and over again nhow about giving u different scene offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie napparently the studio took this film away from it director and chopped it up themselves and it show nthere might ve been pretty decent teen mind fuck movie in here somewhere but guess the suit decided that turning it into music video with little edge would make more sense nthe actor are pretty good for the most part although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty only in new neighborhood nbut my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller who hold her own throughout the entire film and actually ha you feeling her character unraveling noverall the film doesn stick because it doesn entertain it confusing it rarely excites and it feel pretty redundant for most of it runtime despite pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it noh and by the way this is not horror or teen slasher flick it njust packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the

aimless kid into premeditated killer nin the hand of controversial director larry clark kid however it ha le to say about it subject matter and more to say about the filmmaker pornographic proclivity nin term of the incident and what provoked it bully stir up nothing new nthe high schoolers are presented a uniformly screwed up lot bored with life not much ambition promiscuous profane nthe bully in

crab and the gator presumably finish him off nthere no remorse the next day they re talking about it a openly a homework assignment nthey did it because they wanted to and because they could nwhat most troubling about the film however isn the unsettling subject matter and the matter of fact way these young people go about eliminating one of their own but the way in which clark is constantly distracted by his own material nnot only is the nudity plentiful and graphic in bully but there also an uneasy exploitative feel to it ngratuitous crotch shot abound one of which make the zipper cut away in there something about mary look like the height of subtlety nclark is so pre occupied with his female predominantly lead that you forget at time what this movie is supposed to be about nthe stripping bare literally and figuratively of these actor who are after all playing underage teenager becomes harder to watch over time a you begin to feel for them and question the motif of the man

worth his talent nit worse than that nit aggravating for the sole reason that it story could be so much more could be totally intelligent and it open up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be

bud kevin dunne gary sinise who character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn who also in this and watch a it happens nthere a big name in the crowd and that the secretary of defense charles kirkland joel fabiani who sitting behind rick and who get shot second after the heavyweight champion lincoln tyler stan shaw is knocked out nthis all happens in the opening shot and it creates so many red herring and possibility of what happened that it open this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction nwhat really happened this film asks and it set this film up extremely well for when rick begin to question people and get different perspective on the scene and ndiscovers there a very good possibility it wa conspiracy na we follow rick trying to learn of more information we also meet woman who wa talking to kirkland before he wa shot carla gugino and who flees the scene in panic and try to hide from the cop in the arena and the adjacent casino hotel since the cop have blocked off the door so they can get witness take on what happened nthis is all going pretty fine and dandy and it extremely interesting to watch then nit take one wrong step nwe follow the wrong character and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on and way before rick can find it out nbut that not the worst part of it it that it the one person you didn think it would be because he wa too obviously supposed to be the red herring the one you didn think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it nit only get worse the film turn into chase film about half way through the film and since we already know what happened we can rely on rick investigation to be all that interesting nit a if the film ran out of the gut to be really complex and original about third of the way in and decided to just fall back on an easy way out and that just happens to mean that it ha to become le and le credible nevents become more and more proposterous and by the end the film ha decided to rely on the worst offender in mystery like this the deux ex machina nthat where some outside intereference brings the film to sudden conclusion and

great ability at making character flaw come to life like he did in depalma earlier carlito way film that dove right into the life and past of it character and examined him extremely well nhe can write flawed character but his rick santoro seems to be just half assed effort nhe flawed and we can see redemption if the story wasn so formulaic na scene towards the end where he ha to make fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer ha no emotional buildup nhe may a well have said the opposite of what he say it would have at least gone with what the character wa like nthis is the most disappointing kind of film because it promise intelligence and complexity because it promise disection of flawed character and perhaps even redemption then pull the rug from under u just a we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way na wa watching the first half hour couldn wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed how many different perspective he be given and perhaps he have to make choice between who he ha to believe nnow there a film nunfortunately the film ha two major deux ex machinas one in the disasterous ending the other about half hour in when the film go

to go and how bad could it be nturns out wa right mostly ninspector gadget oddly enough follows almost exactly the same format a my favorite martian down to the jive talking side kick nat first thought it wa done by the same people but imdb informs me that ig wa directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin where mfm wa directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver nthis odd similarity between the two movie may best be explained by the studio that produced it where formula isn just business it a way of life nthe producer who obviously micromanaged the two project should get prominant screen credit nin some part you can just hear them saying more zany ni want more zany here and here let have really painful sexual reference for no reason right here make it really painful ni want the audience squirming in their seat ok that fine but want you to add bug gut what doe this scene do ncharacter depth nbut where the zaniness ni don see zany here nif you can make it zany cut it nthe latter is the only explanation can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie nmichelle who play penny gadget niece shine in every scene she in but unfortunately she only get about nine minute of screen time nmy guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor ndabney coleman comedic talent are utterly wasted a chief quimby ni kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film but instead he doe the best he can with some really poor line in few unexceptional scene nhe is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri a the gidget bitch from hell town mayor noteri overly enthusiastic and continually self congratulatory speech pattern and mannerism were so much like portland oregon own manic mayor vera katz that had to wonder if the studio wasn poking fun at our fair town nor maybe all career politician are like that ni must say matthew broderick doe not stroll through inspector gadget a he did godzilla nhe appears to have some fun with the film especially a the evil gadget nrupert everett is entertaining a the maniacle claw njoely fisher doe fine a the zany scientist and even better a the zany carbon copy of herself nher performance is one of the few thing worth watching in the film nd hughley play the shuckin and jivin vehicular side kick in role that firmly set emancipation back 20 year nthe dialog is let face it it pretty bad nthe tag line after major set piece battle is faux pa that make no sense in context na lot of the line especially hughley appear to be made up a they go along by people with little gift for ad lib nabout three quarter of the film is somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw ngadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercation not really battle with the evil gadget npenny doe about minute and half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon nlet me rage here just for minute nmichelle trachtenberg wa an excellent choice for the penny character nshe utterly charming and ha excellent experience harriet the spy for the part of the pint size detective nwhy she is so underutilized in this film is real mystery nthe film loses star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting or editing stupidity ninspector gadget is missing the long long stretch of potty humor that among other thing made my favorite martian so unbearable but it a very short movie so perhaps something wa cut at the last moment nprobably the best scene in the film occur during the end credit nthe evil sidekick support group is especially worth seeing and ha an amazing number of cameo appearance for the few second it onscreen nall in all another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action film ni wonder if disney us the revenue for it generally money making cartoon to produce these loser nbut if true why nif they re trying for another mary poppins they need to find team that can produce one and then give them chance to do it', 'at first glance it appears that the home alone movie are brainless slapstick intended for those with mind of 8 year old nthat true of home alone 2 and d bet money that it true of home alone 3 opening soon nbut home alone actually ha lot going for it and the cartoon slapstick doesn get in the way nthe mcalisters all 15 of them are going to france for the holiday nfour adult and eleven kid are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse nthe littlest kid kevin is the victim of the older kid cruelty nkevin patience run out when he learns that his plain cheese pizza ha already been eaten and he going to have to starve nhe attack his big bully brother buzz who had been teasing him nthe fight disrupts the already chaotic dinner spilling milk and soft drink all over the table few cousin and an uncle nthe knee jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin nnobody came to his rescue when he wa being teased but they all point their finger when he fight back nthe ultimate punishment come from mom catherine hara who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night non his way up the stair he tell her that family suck and that he hope never to see any of his family again nthat night the power go out knocking out the alarm clock so the mcalisters wake up in big hurry to get to the airport nin surprisingly plausible setup kevin is mistakenly accounted for and the family head off without him nit interesting that in subtle way his parent never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their child nfirst they delegate the headcount to an older sibling and second they put all the kid in coach while they fly first class nthey re two third of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing child nmeanwhile kevin belief that somehow his wish ha come true nhe finally rid of his family nlife is dream come true nhe can jump on the bed watch rated movie eat gob of ice cream and potato chip and dig through his big brother secret box nslowly the novelty wear off and he settle into the mundane nhe groom himself he doe the laundry he go shopping bought some milk egg and fabric softener nhe also start to miss his family not just for their company but for the security they bring nthe furnace in the basement is scary monster the old man next door is snow shovel murderer and two crook are trying to break into his house nmacaulay culkin is cute but he isn much of an actor nstill we can see that kevin character grows thanks to some good direction and editing nfor example acting ha little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin search out seasonal santa at night just a santa is getting in his car nkevin asks the man to pas on his request he want his family back to the real santa nhe learned how to deal with the furnace nyou turn on the light and it not so scary anymore nhe go to church one evening and there he see the snow shovel murderer who actually turn out to be nice man nthey talk about their fear and kevin learns that age alone doe not make you le afraid nfinally in the last 20 minute kevin confronts his last fear the bandit head on literally nthis last act is full of violent comedic slapstick and after the movie genuine dramatic setup it is dessert nit a lot of fun and it doesn overwhelm the rest of the movie non the whole home alone is great holiday movie njohn williams original score ha the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the mall and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gathering nbut it doe have it flaw nthe smallest problem is that culkin doesn act very well na said before he is cute but repeated viewing reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkin insight into his character nthe biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda the villain threaten kevin life about five time ninstead of m gonna get that kid they say m gonna kill that kid nsome might argue that the tone is the same but strongly disagree nmixing comedy with specific and viable threat of murder is sociopathic faux pa ni ll probably never see home alone 3 and wish had skipped home alone 2 but do enjoy home alone almost every year ndon let your impression of the others detract from the original which ha much more to offer than cartoon slapstick', 'synopsis bobby garfield yelchin life in small town with his mirthless

movie heart in atlantis easily recall another king inspired coming of age film stand by me both in term of it setting and the sentiment it conveys heart is tribute to the magic of childhood to those summer when the day seem neverending and nothing mean more than your closest friend nunlike stand by me there is supernatural element to heart but although it is key to the plot it is not prominent nlike stand by me this is mostly character driven film and a such it benefit greatly from superb casting nyelchin is very good a bobby finding good mix of innocence and resignation nmore splendid still is boorem whom praised highly for her work in along came spider and who is simply radiant here a carol nand then there is hopkins who despite playing such quiet introspective character a ted nonetheless command our attention every time he is onscreen nless successful is davis whose strident elizabeth come across a overly cartoonish ni also found it odd that bobby and carol other friend sully whose death a an adult set up the movie flashback framing device is paid virtually no attention nbut hick direction is lovely without being cloying and despite the movie general lack of incident it never cease to weave it spell over the audience', 'apparently director tony kaye had major battle with new line regarding his new film american history i don know the detail of the fight but it seems that he is not happy with the final product and nearly removed his name from the credit altogether ni ve heard about this kind of thing happening before and it make me wonder how much input studio ha over the film they produce na it is found american history to be an extremely good film not just because of tony kaye focused look at the touchy subject of racism but because of powerful charismatic performance from edward norton nit hard to believe that it ha only been two year since norton fantastic role in primal fear but here he is now starring in his own film and making himself star nnorton is one of those performer who becomes his character and his work in american history is one of the very best performance this year nhe play young man named derek vinyard skinhead living in venice beach with his brother danny edward furlong mother beverly angelo and sister davin jennifer lien nthe film open with flashback in which derek brutally kill two black men vandalizing his car nwe find out that this land him in prison and the film from that point is seen through the eye of danny nin the present time of the film danny is in high school and eager to follow the footstep of his brother nmuch of the film is told in flashback and we see the path that lead to derek adoption of white supremacy nwhen derek is released having served three year in prison he find that his brother is now full blown skinhead derek however ha given up the violence and try to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that come with it are bad thing nwhat make this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid thoughtless people they are intelligent and articulate and voice their belief in disturbingly straightforward term nit hard to make controversial movie and not preach but kaye ha found the right note for his material nbecause american history is mainstream film there ha to be redemption phase for our main character some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic ni partially disagree with this because although do not advocate racism in any way it interesting the way kaye present derek he is loud obnoxious man but he also very smart nthe reason for why he becomes skinhead are believable his father wa arbitrarily killed by group of black men nit clear that he passionate about his belief and that he not just punk looking for an excuse to beat people up nof course it help that kaye ha an actor a talented a norton to play this part nit astonishing how frightening norton look with shaved head and swastika on his chest nin addition to getting the look just right he perfect for this role derek requires intelligence depth and whole lot of shouting and norton doe it all with ease neven when he at his meanest derek ha likable quality to him and that a gutsy approach when telling story about skinhead nwhat add depth to the story is subplot in which the principal of danny school avery brook becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny nthe other performance are all terrific with standouts from furlong angelo and lien nvisually the film is very powerful nkaye indulges in lot of interesting artistic choice and most of them work nicely lot of slow motion and strange camera angle add to moody atmosphere nbut like lot of movie lately american history skim past greatness in the last few minute nalthough the climactic scene is very moving the picture end with pretentious preachy resolution featuring brief narration from character who wa killed nfor movie so smart subtle up until that point it felt like slap in the face to be hand fed theme in such simplistic way nit make me wonder what exactly tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film nperhaps this last scene wa the problem nit hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with film this good in time when so many movie are timid and weak american history manages to make compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way', 'the most common and in many case the only complaint against francis ford coppola 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia which is presented a an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtue like honour loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler kinder age nmartin scorsese another italoamerican moviemaker confronted that perspective with his own more down to earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean street movie that dealt with lower echelon of organised crime nunfortunately for scorsese his film wa unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola influence on mafia portrayal in the movie nseventeen year later scorsese returned to mean street of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime nthis film wa goodfellas epic black comedy which is today considered a one of the best and most influential film of 1990s ngoodfellas owes some of it initial success and popularity to the fact that it wa based on the true story told in best seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi who would co write the screenplay for the film nthe book a well a the film chronicled thirty year in the life of henry hill played by ray liotta irish italian criminal from new york nat the age of 13 he get recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero played by paul sorvino local mob bos and gradually climb up the ladder starting with small errand nafter couple of year together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito played by joe pesci he join the crew of expert thief led by jimmy conway played by robert de niro nthree of them spend year a best friend and associate gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprise that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robbery in american history nwealth influence and privilege of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen played by lorraine bracco who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelity domestic abuse arrest and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business nbut the perfect world of wiseguys gradually begin to fall apart tommy unpredictable outburst of homicidal violence jimmy reluctance to share his part of the loot with partner and finally henry own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friend ngoodfellas is an excellent example of film that represents work of film genius in his full glory nscorsese managed to create vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradiction that would ripped the film apart in the hand of le talented filmmaker nworld depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating nscorsese spare no effort to show u all the violence hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny nafter being exposed to two and half hour of the film and three decade of criminal history based on some notorious real life event the audience understands why the character chose such dangerous life path trading the superficial and short lasting glamour and prosperity of criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizen nscorsese also manages to break viewer moralistic inhibition by showing truly revolting material scene that depict personal tragedy broken home human depravity violence bloodshed and murder in all their uncompromising reality but in manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience nwith the use of ironic soundtrack manipulative shot character dialogue or narrator commentary goodfellas represents the new standard of black humour that would became very popular few year later during tarantino era neven if we don pay attention to skill with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining we should admit that scorsese display his talent of truly original and creative filmmaker nfirst we might notice unusual structure of the plot relatively minor subplot is used a movie ironic prologue nthen instead of single narrator scorsese switch to the second character a narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards nthis multiple point of view both in term of narration and various subjective shot only lengthens the ironic distance towards character and their situation nsame ironic distance come with extremely effective choice of soundtrack nnostalgia for good old time is illustrated with easy listening 1950s pop song while depression paranoia and bad time find their expression in more neurotic rock song of late 1960s and 1970s nbut the soundtrack is most effective when it is used a ironic comment almost pastoral easy listening tune make strong and very ironic contrast to the scene of violence and bloodshed nhowever thing most associated with this film is couple of continuo shot that feature character moving through large room and interacting with dozen if not hundred of people nsuch scene although they require very great skill and patience during their shooting became very popular among other director in 1990s nfragmentary character of the screenplay which doesn have straight plot and instead base film on series of loosely connected vignette give another interesting opportunity for scorsese nhe us this structure of film to experiment and most successful of such experiment is hilarious day in life segment near the end of the film nanother essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talent nthe most respectable among them is robert de niro but his character who happen to be most quiet and business like member of criminal trio get overshadowed by two of his friend and colleague njoe pesci deserved his oscar for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy and his line including ad libs probably represent the most memorable element of the film nray liotta although equally talented perhaps doesn look a the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film nliotta henry hill look somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low level street thug nliotta on the other hand improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction nlorraine bracco is on the other hand very effective and believable a karen hill wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool a her husband npaul sorvino is also very effective a patriarch mafioso and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low a pestering small time gangster who unknowingly dig his own grave na combination of clever sociological study black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great film could do work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time nbecause of this achievement and also because of the great influence on future filmmaker this cinematic gem deserves it rightful place among the best film of 1990s', 'unzipped is cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi an artist whose palette is fabric nostensibly the film is documentary but use of that term requires stretching it meaning nmany scene appear staged and great deal of cutting and pasting ha been done in the editing room nthe cinema verite effect is conceit genuine spontaneity is at premium and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera especially would be actress like cindy crawford ndirector douglas keeve who wa mizrahi lover at the time freely admits that he couldn care le about the truth but wa more interested in capturing the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion ndespite violating nearly every rule of legitimate documentary film making however unzipped is remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment nwhile it shed only little light on the behind the scene world of the fashion industry it present fascinating if incomplete picture of designer mizrahi nthis man is the perfect subject for this kind of study he funny energetic and eminently quotable nhe ha unusual view on just about everything from fashion it about woman not wanting to look like cow to mary tyler moore between her and jackie kennedy they shaped this country to style it almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dog nunzipped also give glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turn an idea into dress nit almost certainly different that anyone would imagine nthe designer draw on variety of source for his look including nanook of the north and old bette davis movie then enlists the aid of ouija board to help form the collection nin particular unzipped trace mizrahi development of his fall 1994 line from it inception in the spring to the final fashion show which highlight number of prominent model including cindy crawford naomi campbell kate bush and linda evangelista non the technical side number of interesting choice were made in filming unzipped na variety of film stock were used super 8 16 mm black and white and 35 mm color nthere is purpose to this beyond simple artiness the stock often serf a an emotional key to the movie and during the climactic fashion show color is used to show the audience perspective while black and white is for the behind the scene sequence nnevertheless some viewer will be put off by this treatment nwhile unzipped isn an expose on the fashion industry per se keeve ha enough clip of petulant model to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman wa with ready to wear noverall however this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else and only when viewed from that perspective doe unzipped succeed nwhen the designer declares that everything is frustrating except designing clothes that beautiful and liberating it fit perfectly with the image of him that unzipped ha constructed', 'hong kong cinema ha been going through bad spell nthe last few production have been effect laded action adventure that combine both the best and worst of american

ha the showiest part having to express both an innocent and steadfast determination nallayah in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with certain style and grace nit obvious that the camera love her and she is very photogenic nbut still the part is under written in such way that even poor performance would not have affected it ndelro lindo a issac day carry himself well in the film nan unsung and under appreciated actor mr lindo turn out the film best performance nthe other performer are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for b woodside

in and or better written nfirst time director andrzej bartkowiak doe workmanlike job in handling the film nhaving career a one of the industry best cinematographer bartkiwiak know how to set up his shot and romeo must die doe look good nbut the pacing of the film is lethargic only coming to semblance of life during the fight scene nthe script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such way that we can care about the character or the situation they are in nthe big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of sport center for nfl team is needlessly confusing nand of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here a anthony anderson a allayah bodyguard maurice ha no comic timing whatsoever nthe best thing about the film are it fight scene njet li is master of these intricate physical battle none need only to see his film fist of legend to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat nhere jet is given the opportunity to show off in way that lethal weapon 4 jet u debut didn allow nunfortunately lot of jet fight are aided with computer effect that detract from his ability and precision nalso romeo must die must be noted a having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film and that is an ray effect that appears three time during the course of the film showing the effect of bone crushing blow on an opponent nobviously homage to the famed ray scene from sonny chiba streetfighter the scene here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film nit a if the film ha stopped and video game ha been inserted none problem though about the fight scene nthose that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the film are fantasy and are a removed from reality a any anime or cartoon nthey do have an internal rhythm to them na heartbeat so to speak in their choreography nthe fight scene in hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance nthis is created by the performance the direction and the editing nhere in romeo must die there is no staccato nevery fight scene even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring a the editing both cut away from battle at hand and simple follows set pattern nthe rhythm is monotonous na hong kong film ha tempo that change heightening it emotional impact rmd is limited to standard 4 4 tempo not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever na fine example of this difference can be found by examining couple of jackie chan film nwatch the restaurant fight from the film rush hour and notice that the context of the fight while technically amazing is rather flat the framing and cut always do not help nnow look at the warehouse fight from rumble in the bronx nthere you have heartbeat and emotional draw that doesn let the audience catch it breath nthe stop and pause for dramatic effect work perfectly causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted nhere in romeo must die the fight scene have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl njet li is grand and personable screen presence nit a shame that his full talent were not used to full effect here none day filmmaker here in the s will stop making film by the number and start to embrace the style and emotion that ha made hong kong action picture such commodity nuntil

unrestrained whipping they released upon the fashion industry nsnap nit wa also nice to see several real life model with small role in the movie not taking themselves too seriously nand if you re the

nearly twenty minute before we actually get to see great big gorilla nhis entrance however is grand one out from the tree he leap gargantuan and imposing sporting hand big enough to crush volkswagen bug and pair of foot much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have njoe bellow at the poacher before him angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for million of dollar nduring this scene turned to my friend and said wow nthat some ape njoe is quite gorilla big digital gorilla nhe run around the field chasing car and people nhe pick thing up and stare at them pensively nhe break thing on accident because he just too big to avoid clumsiness njoe a special effect is an image that might hold your interest for five minute na character he doesn quite register nand the story he been put in is a limp a they come nthe word family entertainment have never been stamp of quality but might joe young is just silly special effect movie pretending to have heart nthe picture is remake of the 1949 film nit mostly just about the big gorilla but strictly a formality the movie also ha few human character nthe main one is jill young poor charlize theron forced to waste her talent lover of gorilla na child she witnessed group of poacher murder her mother now she life in the jungle to protect the wildlife nspecifically she out to protect joe giant gorilla who ha been her friend since her childhood nsoon zoologist gregg hara bill paxton discovers joe he quickly realizes that poacher want to get joe and sell him to big game hunter named strasser rade sherbedgia who just happens to be the same guy who killed jill mother nso in an effort to save joe jill and gregg take the big gorilla to preserve where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poacher nin addition the space is way too small for him after all he is really big gorilla nand to add to the complication strasser show up under benevolent pretext he tell jill that he ha preserve big enough for joe and joe recognizes strasser a the guy who killed jill mother njill of course doesn recognize strasser even though he did kill her mother nthis is just one of the many example of stupidity in mighty joe young film that fulfills every stereotype that come with special effect film nthe movie isn really offensive it ha some competent actor few nifty set and lot of scene with big digitized gorilla nbut the story is really dumb there aren any character and the film isn satisfying on any level beyond it visuals nthe movie also ha bad dialogue nif critic say that film ha bad dialogue it only fair to quote some of it but most of the word spoken in this picture are phrase like joe isn happy nand joe isn safe here we need to get joe out of here joe is way too big for that cage ni don know if these phrase are word for word but they re close na said the character here are only present a formality they do little more than state the obvious of course joe is too big for that cage npaxton and theron are talented performer who deserve to work on script that provides character for them nsadly mighty joe young waste them both nthere are few clever moment although none of them are surfacing in my memory at the moment and a said the digital effect held my attention for at least five minute nit certainly not bad film for kid doubt joe will give them nightmare nbut adult in the audience aren likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla na big gorilla is only interesting for little while after that something need to be done with the big gorilla nnobody ever figure out what to do with the big gorilla', 'one sided doom and gloom documentary about the possible annihilation of the human race a foretold by the bible norson welles narrates and appears in the film in which he along with best selling author hal lindsey discus various prophecy from the bible and relates them to recent well for 1976 anyway event nthe film is dated badly a many thing that are supposed to happen in the future never do nfor example the planet of the solar system were supposed to line up in the year 1982 and cause chaos here on earth nwe re still here nthe arm race between the soviet and america wa supposed to kick off the apocalypse nwe re still here nsome of the more ludicrous moment come when it alluded to that people like jimmy carter and henry kissinger may actually be the antichrist nalso there ten minute of stock footage at the end of the film meant to give u an idea of what the battle for armageddon might be like nif it anything like it depicted a here then it going to be incredibly boring nthe late great planet earth is available on dvd from vci home video nit contains the film in standard form aspect ratio of 1 33 1 although some moment of stock footage are letterboxed nalso included are brief bios on orson welles and hal lindsey a well a trailer for another recent vci home video release chariot of the god naudio is mono dolby digital and the video is fair to good for film like this ni believe this is the first appearance of this film on any home video format so any condition at all is fine with me ncertainly never expected remastered print ncuriously the menu screen on this dvd look nothing like the menu screen pictured on the back of the case nbut they re menu screen nso who really care pg', 'the world on land it just too big for me nstarring tim roth pruitt taylor vince bill nunn clarence williams iii nrated nthe legend of 1900s is the year most absurd movie rambling nonsensical piece of seafaring garbage that go nowhere fast nit star thespian extraordinaire tim roth looking wistful a ever a guy named n1900 nyou heard right nhis name is in all actuality 1900 nhe wa born on an ocean liner on 1 1 1900 uh hence the name abandoned and adopted by danny ship crewman n1900 spends most of his early year hiding in the bowel of the ship because of danny fear that he might be taken away from him because of visa matter nwell when 1900 is about 9 or so he start wondering all around the ship none day he discovers grand piano nhe sits down and start playing nmiraculously what come out is beautiful na group of onlooker gather to watch this stunning prodigy make such amazing music at such young age nwhen one of the people who know 1900 tell him that his playing the piano like that without permission is totally against regulation 1900 reply ck the regulation nho ho ho n1900 grows up never setting foot on dry land nwhen he about 30ish and can play the piano like nobody business onboard come another musician nhis name is max pruitt taylor vince and he play the trumpet nafter 1900 catch max barfing everywhere during storm he sits him down on the piano next to him take the piano brace off and play while the piano fly all around the hall taking them with it nhow the chair they re sitting on and the piano don separate don know but this apparently isn the kind of thing we re supposed to ask nafter that 1900 and max become friend nmax is determined to get 1900 off the ship and discover what he is missing on land but 1900 ha no intention of doing so nwhat more he doesn even want his music to go anywhere without him when record company hears about his talent they come on board to make record of his music but after finding out that gasp they re going to make million of copy he break the record nthe conflict of the movie is that after max unsuccessful in his endeavor to get 1900 off the ship get off himself he stumble upon record of 1900 music in store nthe record shouldn exist because 1900 never stepped on dry land and the one record that wa made on the ship wa broken nladies and gentleman it a mystery nthe story itself is ludicrous and uninteresting and so are it element nwe re supposed to be roused by climactic npiano duel nthere isn anything in this movie with the potential to compel n1900 come off a whiny brooding extremely unlikable man can recall single word he said that wa not some sort of depressing pseudo meditation on life nditto for max who doesn seem to have life outside his friendship with 1900 ntim roth play 1900 with about a much panache a fig leaf there no spirit no gusto to the character nhe insists that he lead happy life on the ship but to u he is dead npruitt taylor vince is little more palatable at least providing moment of comic relief here and there to liven thing up bit nthe highlight of the movie would have to be the eminently amusing clarence williams the iii a the arrogant leering king of jazz who challenge 1900 to the aforementioned piano duel nthe legend of 1900 wa made by giuseppe tornatore whose 1988 cinema paradiso is considered masterpiece by many nthis effort is utterly limp and lifeless nat once ridiculous boring narrow sighted and pointless this is one movie that should be and will be quickly forgotten', 'when _star wars_ came out some twenty year ago the image of traveling throughout the star ha become commonplace image nwhen the millenium falcon move throughout the star we see constellation meteor shower and cool space ship nwhen han solo go light speed the star change to bright line going towards the viewer in line that converge at an invisible point ncool n_october sky_ offer much simpler image that of single white dot traveling horizontally across the night sky nwas it really only forty year ago when sputnik wa launched and that before then no satellite ever existed nhave we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it wa nearly two generation ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see then technological achievement even though it wa from the russian nit sound hokey but when that scene occurs near the beginning of _october sky_ found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam played by jake gyllenhaal ndetermined to make dent in the space race he becomes transfixed with his desire to make rocket that could fly like the best of them nit is film like this that we know the ending a we buy the ticket nwhen lovely teacher miss riley played by laura dern suggests that he enters his finding into the national science fair we know exactly who is going to win nbut the joy in film like this is in the little detail nfor example homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class nif he ha any strength whatsoever it is an undeterring vision and good organizer nit mean that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school who know more about rocket science than he doe nit mean that if his father forbids him to shoot rocket on company property that is the entire coal mining town he must walk eight mile one way just to set up the rocket which will fail fail fail and fail again nhomer dad is played by chris cooper favorite actor of mine since _lone star_ nhere he play the antithesis of the character he played in _matewan_ instead of organizing union rally he is the head of the coal miner who is constantly wringing his hand against the union nthis is will be one of the great unnoticed performance of the year note how multi dimensional his character is nhe is his son last nemesis a one who most likely interferes with his son dream nbut he truly love his son and want to see him succeed the only way he know how nthrough coal mining nbecause of his character we can see how far we ve come nthe revolution of modern technology ha allowed for u to see society advanced at rate far faster than any generation before u nwe don understand that there were the generation from the industrial revolution who knew of no other way to raise family nthe paradigm wa shifting under the father foot and he knew of no other life nso _october sky_ far from being merely feel good inspirational film offer much food for thought nand this is the best type of inspirational film the one that you take something with you nbtw the final image of the film is just a simple is a strong contrast a the aforementioned horizontal moving white dot against the night sky background nanother commonplace image to be sure but it must have been breathtaking forty year ago', 'warning contains what the matrix

played by costumed actor or an image nin movie like contact the special effect serve the story nin spawn they are the story nand spawn himself isn even an interesting character nthe film reliance on

on display from the effect team nthe cast is superb and listening to their dialogue spoken with thick jamaican accent half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang just add to the interest npaul campbell a the loose cannon capone essay his role perfectly displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right time nmark danvers evokes sympathy a ratty the part time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football field and organizing block party to bring people together nunfortunately carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character a the crime bos seems ineffective largely because his underling seem to run all over him but then again that could be the way his character wa intended to be portrayed nthe music in the

once the film ha left theater nchris blackwell founder of palm picture wa also involved in the production of another jamaican box office smash in 1981 entitled countryman so d say he ha pretty good track record noverall third world cop is pretty entertaining homage to the film of john woo ringo lam tsui hark and many other action film by director from hong kong nif action film are your thing and you don mind intermittent subtitle then you can go wrong with this film nthe performance and the story are solid if only little cliched and the action is tight ni not sure what the other jamaican film

series but m not really sure why nit an exciting often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film nsome say it a bit too light and more of long episode than film nothers say the special effect are cheesy and that it boring ni simply enjoyed the film ninsurrection which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast introduces u to race of

is why believe non fan have hard time getting into star trek in order to enjoy it one ha to understand how to approach it ninsurrection however doe surprisingly good job of u new aspect of the character nstewart is bold a always magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together njonathan frakes who also directed is funny a commander riker subplot with data brent spiner discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting and abraham make perfect star trek villain overacting like crazy nfrakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact insurrection is an exciting film with some really attractive special effect and lot of good action nthis is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation and the result is very pleasing to the eye particularly in the climactic scene in which the son employ giant space ship to suck up the ring of the ba ku planet the special effect have clean impressively sharp look nif have any complaint about the film it that it try to take moral stance when it not very appropriate to do so ni don think it that big of deal that the federation wanted to move 600 ba ku in order to save the life of thousand nbetter yet why couldn they have co existed ninsurrection feel little to light to spring these kind of big moral question on the audience nwith it inherent camp factor the star

beast is not something one can suppress for long nmoreau ha no doubt very interesting premise within it grasp neven so the production ha failed to make the most out of it nthere are too many character to put your attention to and the worst thing is the character are not prioritized so when the audience is led to believe that particular character is important before they know it he or she or it perishes rather nungloriously at time too nperhaps there is some redemption in the development of the beast people especially aissa balk the most human of moreau creation nthe two very important character montgomery and dr moreau himself receive no development at all and it is in this area that the script fails miserably nmore screen time could have been used for character interaction and development ni really would have liked it better if say they delved more into dr moreau obsession montgomery purpose in the story and justification to a why the beast people had to rebel nmaybe the nature of the screenplay which incidently doe not incorporate much action sequence in the film forced the filmmaker to cut long story short and make it more of an action film than anything else it

sham artist in addition to being police officer he must be able to think on his foot and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence or failing that must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower nmost of all the negotiator must be able to enter situation with a little intelligence about the scenario a possible and quickly gain control

negotiator and spacey the actor na the second protagonist spacey measure up nicely ngray really lucked out with this cast ndavid morse a commander beck ron rifkin a commander frost and john spencer a police chief al travis are all more than competent and can hold their own in scene with jackson and spacey nthe only problem is the bit of typecasting that result from these choice morse played

better movie where certain talent didn go to waste', 'a african american detective vergil tibbs question suspected white murderer inside jail cell there is wonderful eye catching shot which instantaneously present the main message of the entire film nthe shot ha tibbs face completely covered by the shadow of the prison bar nto see these bar blocking his face we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the character in the film na black detective conducting an investigation in southern town full of violent white bigot no matter how innocent tibbs is he is still seen by these bigot a threat simply because of the color of his skin nthe bar show that tibbs ha not been given fair chance to show exactly who he is instead others have chosen him a different and dangerous nthis one shot amazes me because it capture whole theme in matter of second nit perhaps may be the most powerful image have seen in film in the heat of the night wa the first and the best of the three film norman jewison directed concerning racism in america njewison ha very keen style of displaying various case of racism a he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental nin these three film he doe an excellent job creating very detailed equal analysis of character from the abused to the abuser nhe is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society wa in the past and is in the present npreceding the very original soldier story and the recently released the hurricane in the heat of the night contains some classic line and some very memorable character nthe film which won best picture in 1967 focus on vergil tibbs played superbly by sidney poitier a fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuse to give up on an investigation in white town where is he not wanted ntibbs is man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him na hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chain tibbs is the perfect protagonist npoitier also give an excellent noteworthy voice to his character nnever nervous and always commanding his speech pattern are very manipulative a they range from stentorian to soothing nhowever unlike the hurricane where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast poitier share the spotlight with rod steiger who won best actor for his excellent performance na sheriff who help tibbs and warns him of the danger around him steiger show great amount of skill in his role nhe start off a racist and blind a the other townspeople nhe would refer to tibbs a boy and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him na the film progress though there is very gradual change in the sheriff nhe begin to see the hardship tibbs face and he see the foolishness of his own neighbor nwhat really enjoyed about steiger character wa that he did not completely abandon his friend or connect with tibbs at the end of the film nhe still could not refer to tibbs a mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil ninstead it wa apparent that he wa eventually going to see the world differently in the future nmost movie would have character reversing all of his belief and influence in matter of minute nthis action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day njewison determination to make this film a realistic a possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate in the heat of the night show the difference between the north and the south or major city and small town in the united state during the 1960 nit display this perfectly nhowever the actual investigation although it is not the main focus of the film lack interest nit seemed rushed especially towards the end a if jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving credible explanation involving the murder victim nthere were way too many character added during the last fifteen minute and some of the scene during this time period were inane police officer sam being suspect wa not needed nalso it is given that tibbs is vigilant homicide detective who is the best at what he doe but some of his discovery came out of nowhere and how he found out some of the important case detail towards the end were never answered nthe rushed ending wa the only mistake of this otherwise memorable jewison classic a congratulation ha to be given to actor scott wilson nhe managed to be in the two best movie of 1967 in the heat of the night and the even better in cold blood', 'plot young french boy see his parent killed before his eye by tim roth oops nmean an evil man nhe vow revenge on that man and is taught the way of the musketeer by some old dude who used to be one himself nanyway fourteen year go by and arrgh well you know the rest swish swish zzzzzzz ncritique this is pretty bad movie nlet see where should start nokay first of all the story is just plain boring nit not original is entirely predictable and lack energy nokay what next nacting you say nhmmmm well the main actor justin chamber is basically an uncharismatic version of chris donnell but with le range think about that and mena suvari is just plain off nnot a bad a thora birch wa in dungeon dragon but entirely miscast with bad delivery awful sequence and piss poor accent that come and go nnow m not sure if this wa m suvari fault or the director but ve definitely seen her at much higher level than in this film nthe only semi saving grace actor wise is tim roth a the irrepressible bad guy but once again it not something that we haven seen before nthousand time by the same guy ntim please for the love of god beg your agent to ask the marketplace for some modern day american role for you a nice guy in romantic comedy or something nstretch dude stretch nwe all know that you can do much better than this gunk nalright what else wa bad in this film noh yeah the score nyikes how about taking it down few notch there fella nthis thing blare in your ear whenever it feel the need to accentuate certain scene but actually doe little more than annoy ni think it important for the man behind the music to recognize that this film isn a real epic by any stretch of the imagination nit a fluffy rehashed cake walk created by some shrewd studio head who decided to take advantage of the whole kung fu phenomenon in film and test it out on an old classic ndudes you nfailed all around keep reading nthe editing is also pretty shoddy in this movie the dialogue banal and stilted and the plot problem plentiful why doe the guy on top of the horse carriage just stand there when his opponent take forever scampering his way back to the top nwhy don they just cut the mouseketeer rope at the top of the tower instead of jumping down on their own chord and fighting him while hanging nwhy doesn anybody look day older when the sequence say 14 year later at least change nyour shirt man nkeep in mind that have never strayed away from championing certain movie that are created simply for the sake of fun time but this flick just didn cut it for me nit wa boring for stretch the acting wa atrocious at time the romantic scene between suvari and chamber next to the lake reminded me of play in high school which made you cringe there wa little reason to care for anyone and since when were the musketeer fat ni will give the movie this much and that is that it main reason for being it raison etre a the french would say it fight sequence do come through despite the lack of their number in the film ni wa hoping that the movie would be packed with cool stuntwork a promoted in it trailer but what you see there are essentially the snippet from the two major and cool swashbuckling sequence from the film nthe first come right at the beginning of the movie while the other essentially finish the film off hanging from the tower and juggling off ladder nthe ladder sequence itself is definite keeper but unfortunately the rest of the movie is just regurgitated crap nand can anyone please tell me how catherine deneuve got her name placed at the top of this film credit nhullo nthe film is called the musketeer and star dude name justin chamber ndeneuve is barely in this movie nugh just another small thing that annoyed me about this trash nnow say it together

charles ha nsummary lawrence woolsley john goodman brings his new horror film mant nto premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis nhe hope to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town nwe see most of the event through the story of four teenager and how life affect them nquick and easy review really enjoyed matinee nthe mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely nunlike many comedy this film try and succeeds in getting past the stage of doing anything for laugh nthe maker of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story nthe performance of all the principal are right on the mark particularly john goodman a the schlock master nso would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for light hearted yet interesting way to spend couple of hour nlonger more detailed review beware of spoiler nthe primary reason enjoyed this film wa that while being comedy the film also had an intelligent story to tell ntoo many comedy today subscribe to the the notion that comedy need only make you laugh nyou watch the movie laugh lot leave the theatre and take nothing with you nmatinee is not like that ni left the picture thinking about what would do faced with the cuban missile crisis ni found myself wondering what would happen to the character of the film nbut most importantly found myself caring about what would happen to the character nthe comedy of the film center around goodman his character and the film he brings to key west ni believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actor in the business today nhe is highly expressive both physically and vocally ni felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink nthe other character are often lost in scene with him due to his commanding nature however while the star goodman is actually not at the center of the film nthe movie is really the story of the four teenager discovering who they are and what they want against background where at any minute it could all end ni thought the kid reaction were highly realistic nthey tried to block it out they tried to escape from the concern of their world nunfortunately it kept creeping back in particularly with the fear and the chaos of the time nwhile the comedy centered on goodman and the drama on the teen there wa great deal of overlap nseveral aspect of the panic are shown in humorous light none example is scene where people are fighting each other for the the last can and box of food in grocery store nif you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for comedy but it work here nanother reason like this film is that like science fiction movie none of my favorite film to go watch is plan 9 from outer space note did not say it wa one of my favorite movie but one of my favorite to see nwhile mant nnever got made many film like it were and mant nserves mostly a dante homage to the film he love nso again would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for good humorous story nthis isn a gag film like many other comedy but an intelligent well thought out film about real people with real problem told in an often hilarious way nenjoy', 'carry on matron is the last great carry on film in my opinion nmade in 1972 it still feature most of the regular of this genre nsid james play the head of gang of crook intent on stealing contraceptive pill from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make profit kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting head of the hospital but also hypochondriac hattie jacques re take her role a matron and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr goode nthe joke come in fast and so do the laugh with humorous antic between the matron and sir bernard nthis time williams is after matron jacques when he need to prove himself that he is man after visiting dr goode nthe doctor hawtrey is sworn to secrecy assure you that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other nbernard think he is having sex change and need to prove himself nthere are great cameo from joan sims an expectant mother who is many week overdue and is eating constantly in every scene and from kenneth connor a the expectant father who still think he at work at the railway station nsid james gang including cyril his son kenneth cope try to find out where the pill are by getting cyril to dress up a nurse and live in at the nurse home nhe ha to share room with nurse ball barbara windsor and she soon see through him nthe film end with the attempted robbery of the hospital pill with panic ensuing nthere are good performance by hattie jacques a the matron however her character seems little more subdued and quieter than her previous matron nwilliams is a usual on top form but sid james isn given very good part in this movie and would forgive anyone to forget that he wa in the movie at all nthe same doe not go for charles hawtrey for although he only first appears in the movie after 30 minute gone and ha scarce screen time he seems to steal every scene he is in nby not making use of sid james and barbara windsor talent to full effect the film seems to flounder but it certainly make up for it with it good storyline and it other appealing character nthis film is genuinely funny and could watch it again and again and not get bored', 'synopsis in this movie steven spielberg one of today finest director attempt to spice up the 1800s story of long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque djimon hounsou young angry man from sierra leone who wa kidnapped into slavery and his fellow prisoner ncinque and friend have landed ship on the shore of america after escaping spanish slave trader but since the american don speak cinque language the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slave ntechnically since the international slave trade wa outlawed at that time people like cinque couldn be kidnapped into slavery one had to be born slave to be legally considered slave nlawyers baldwin and adam matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery rather than born slave in order to get them out of prison a free men nthree lengthy court case are portrayed with spielberg trademark panache flashy beginning lot of facial close ups big music and dramatic imagery na final speech by adam is followed by an anticlimax where subtitle show what eventually happened to the various character nopinion making fictional movie is easier than making one about real life nin fiction one invents purposeful clear cut good guy and bad guy put the fictional character in conflict and take the tale to it exciting conclusion nreal life however consists of long stretch of boredom with few dramatic moment and character who stand around think thought and do nothing or come and go before event are resolved nspielberg give u visually spicy and historically accurate real life story ndjimon hounsou and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performance', 'instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoer will undoubtedly label a powerful or touching ni have name for it myself gross nthis is the sort of film where somebody stand up to bully the bully look at the rebel threateningly about to hurt him and then everyone else whom the bully ha heretofore controlled stand up too nhow that scene is still present in so many movie today appalls me aren present day moviegoer beyond being inspired by something like that nthis is one example there are actually some more in instinct alone of filmmaker insulting the audience intelligence ninstinct plot is brimming with potential world renowned anthropologist ethan powell anthony hopkins disappeared for two year whilst doing research in the jungle of africa nhe wa found and is coming back to the united state convicted killer he murdered to african policeman who were allegedly trying to capture him nafter committing few more brutal act of violence in the airport the authority stick him in prison psychotic ward nassigned to do an evaluation on powell is bright or so we are told young psychiatrist theo caulder cuba gooding jr ncaulder start out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career nof course and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way he start really caring for powell and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not psychotic and that he should not be in prison nand then there the inevitable heartless meanie character in the form of donald sutherland who play caulder mentor nhe care for caulder but doe everything he can to discourage him from helping powell nlet get one thing straight dr theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist have ever seen on screen or off nany good shrink will listen to what his patient ha to say no matter the subject because any good shrink will learn great deal about his patient that way nnot good old theo nno he asks purposefully pointed question and when powell dare to venture to another subject caulder say we need to talk about this right now nthis is flaw only in the sense that it detracts from instinct already dubious credibility unfortunately it also the least of it problem ndirector jon turteltaub who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon a well a the surprisingly above par cool running decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that contrary to what this movie promotion would have you believe it ha much more in common with patch adam than with the silence of the lamb nit not the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tear to your eye what dream may come aptly demonstrated that but the kind that brings vomit up your esophagus excuse the graphic depiction nit aim to inspire rather than to touch heart na yoda would say inspire it doe not nit is the ultimate sign of futility when screenwriter the very experienced gerald di pego ha to resort to literally telling the audience movie story nindeed somewhere in the beginning of instinct one of the character actually read aloud the film plot to another character nthis like the instance mentioned in the first paragraph of this review is horrid insult to our intelligence ni am forced to wonder whether turteltaub and di pego did not think that we could figure out what instinct is about simply from regular conversation ni think that anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actor and he chew the scenery in this movie brilliant a ever noscar winner cuba gooding jr on the other hand is dreadful nhis performance is at least part of what make his character seem so incapable of being shrink ni liked the guy in jerry maguire a well a in a good a it get but here he fails to project any shred of credibility or real feeling ni love animal and instinct prominent save the gorilla live in harmony with nature theme is certainly something could sympathize with nhowever this movie execution is completely unacceptable ntone down the violence and this will be chick flick 1999 eugene novikov', 'm currently accepting all future name for
